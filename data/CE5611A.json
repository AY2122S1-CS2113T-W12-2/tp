{"acadYear":"2020/2021","description":"This module provides participants with inâ€?depth knowledge on the role of constituent materials of concrete such as cements, mineral admixtures, and chemical admixtures and their interactions that affect properties of fresh and hardened concrete. It also provides participants with inâ€?depth knowledge on concrete response to stresses, timeâ€?dependent deformations, and durability of concrete exposed to severe environments. The module discusses the basic considerations and design philosophy for performanceâ€?based design of concrete mixtures and production of concrete. It also discusses the progress in concrete technology and the latest development on highâ€?strength, highperformance, lightweight, and selfâ€?compacting concrete. Sustainable\ndevelopment in construction industry and use of recycled aggregates and\nother recycled materials will be discussed as well. The module is targeted\nat practicing engineers.","title":"Specifying Concrete to EN 206","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[1,0.25,0,0.25,3.5],"moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"CE5611A","attributes":{"lab":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":3,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2021-05-15","end":"2021-05-29"},"venue":"LT2","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"A"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0930","endTime":"1230","weeks":{"start":"2021-06-12","end":"2021-06-12"},"venue":"LT1","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"A"}],"covidZones":["A"]}]}
