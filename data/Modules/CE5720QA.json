{"moduleCode":"CE5720QA","title":"Offshore Geomechanics","description":"This module is an introduction of offshore geotechnical engineering which is a pre-requisite to designing of various foundations for supporting ocean and renewable energy infrastructure. Students will learn the fundamental of geotechnical engineering principles that uniquely applied to offshore environment, as opposed to landbased geotechnical engineering, specifically to support ocean and renewable energy infrastructure. The topics covered include: offshore design considerations; site investigations; soil response under cyclic loading, soil testing and interpretations. Furthermore, application of the fundamental to basic offshore foundation systems, i.e. shallow and deep foundations for bottom founded structures, e.g. jacket platform and wind turbines, will be introduced.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Background in Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
