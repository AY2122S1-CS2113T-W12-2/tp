{"moduleCode":"BN2102","title":"Bioengineering Data Analysis","description":"This course will introduce concepts relevant to the interpretation and statistical analysis of experimental results in the bioengineering field. Theoretical explanations will be followed by hands-on tutorials with relevant computational software. Students will learn how to perform some of the most commonly used statistical analysis of experiments (e.g., z and t tests, ANOVA analysis) as well\nas to interpret the results of typical bioengineering experiments by building a suitably fitted mathematical model.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 27, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1100,"venue":"LT7","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":160},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1100,"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1100,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"3","startTime":900,"endTime":1100,"venue":"EA-06-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1100,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EA-06-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40}]}]}
