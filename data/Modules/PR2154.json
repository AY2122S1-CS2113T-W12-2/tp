{"moduleCode":"PR2154","title":"Respiratory System: Science \u0026 Therapeutics","description":"This 6-week module integrates pharmaceutical, clinical and systems sciences to help students recognize, assess, prevent and therapeutically manage conditions affecting the human respiratory system. The drug’s physicochemical properties underpin the formulation of inhalation delivery system. Pharmacology and applied therapeutics inform students on clinical decision making and care plan development. The strong association of smoking to lung cancer, supported by case-control study, is used to illustrate how Trans Theoretical Model for behaviour change adopted in smoking cessation programme can instil health advocacy attitude in students. The classification of medical devices and therapeutic products is used to introduce principles of regulatory science.","moduleCredit":6.0,"department":"Pharmacy","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PR1152 Pharmacy Foundations: Science \u0026 Therapeutics I\nPR1153 Pharmacy Foundations: Science \u0026 Therapeutics II\nPR2156 Integumentary \u0026 Ocular Systems: Science \u0026 Therapeutics","preclusion":"Students admitted into the Pharm Sci major and Pharm Sci minor programmes.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 25, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1800,"venue":"MD1-05-01A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":80},{"classNo":"2","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"C4-02-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1800,"venue":"MD1-05-01A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT33","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":160},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT33","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":160},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"C4-02-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT33","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":160}]}]}
