{"moduleCode":"ESE5001","title":"Environmental Engineering Principles","description":"This course is to allow M.Sc. students from non-environmental engineering background to gain basic knowledge in environmental science and engineering.  Acquisition of this basic knowledge will prepare them for advanced courses in environmental science and engineering.  This module provides a systematic introduction to water and air quality and their engineering control, quantitative overview of the properties of environmental contaminants, and the transport and transformation processes that govern their concentrations in air and water. Topics include environmental chemical equilibriums and kinetics, and elementary transport phenomena, introduction to water quality engineering, air quality engineering, and solid waste treatment and management.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"ESE5901 and ESE5901A, ESE5901B","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 27, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"LT6","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45}]},{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 29, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E1-06-03","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
