{"moduleCode":"PC3295","title":"Radiation for Imaging and Therapy in Medicine","description":"The module gives an introduction to the basic physics, the biology and the applications of radiation in medical imaging and radiation therapy. After a review of basic radiation physics and the relevant radiobiology, the currently used major modes of diagnostic and interventional imaging are covered. This will be followed by a discussion of the major methods of radiation cancer therapy (by photons, protons and electrons).","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC1144 Physics IV OR PC1432/PC1432X Physics IIE OR PC2232 Physics for Electrical Engineers OR PC2020 Electromagnetics for Electrical Engineers OR PC2130B Applied Quantum Physics.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"S11-0205","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"S11-0205","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
