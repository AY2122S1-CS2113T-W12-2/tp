{"moduleCode":"USP2203","title":"Medium and Meaning in Cinema","description":"Motion pictures of all types—including cinema, television, advertising--pervade our everyday lives, shaping how we construe meaning and experience, yet we tend to know very little about how that meaning is constructed. The medium of motion pictures relies on a limited and identifiable set of concrete technologies-- lighting, angle, aspect ratio, sound, editing, mise en sce?ne, etc.--that serve to manipulate temporality and spatiality and to thereby create meaning. This module leads students to examine the affordances and constraints of the medium of film for the making of meaning in motion pictures, with a focus on cinema.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
