{"moduleCode":"YSC2244","title":"Programming for Data Science","description":"With the growing influence of Data Science, the Statistics and Mathematics domains now require specific skills in programming, using domain-specific systems and libraries. This course introduces common tools for  Data Science programming. This includes a high-level language (i.e. Python), several Statistics/AI libraries (i.e. numpy, sklearn), and database systems (i.e. SQL). In addition we will create awareness of best practices in programming such as control versioning, testing, and continuous integration.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC1212 Introduction to Computer Science or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25}]}]}
