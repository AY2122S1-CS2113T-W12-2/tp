{"moduleCode":"TS4220","title":"Shakespeare and Film","description":"This module provides a study of how the literary and performance traditions associated with Shakespeare\u0027s work are mobilized and transformed by the visual cultures of contemporary cinema. Through the intersections between the mediums of the dramatic text, theatre and film, the course examines central issues that shape Shakespeare\u0027s currency and circulation in the cinema: the values attached to authenticity and performance traditions, the Shakespearean actor, the appropriation and parody of the \"universality\" of Shakespeare, and the transformation of the meaningfulness of his plays through visuality and spectacle.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS or 28 MCs in EN or 28 MCs in EU/LA (French/ German/Spanish)/recognised modules or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS or 28 MCs in EN or 28 MCs in EU/LA (French/ German/Spanish)/recognised modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
