In this context, the module explores international law vis-à-vis issues such as (non-)international armed conflict, large-scale collective violence, non-state militancy, counter-insurgency and environmental destruction. Accordingly, topics covered by the module include the international law of armed conflict, international criminal law and international environmental law.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, or 28MCs in SC or 28MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours Track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
