{"moduleCode":"GE3251","title":"Southeast Asia","description":"What do we mean by Southeast Asia? Are we referring to a physical area? A shared history? A group of distinct nations? Or is Southeast Asia a constantly changing flow of people, capital, and beliefs? We explore these questions to better understand how ideas about a region influence our relationships to each other and the wider world. We investigate the construction of political boundaries, socio-ecological challenges of economic development, and diversity of social and cultural landscapes in the region. Students will learn to apply key concepts and practices from human geography to critically investigate historical and contemporary Southeast Asia.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GE2226","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":75},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS8-0401","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":23},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS1-0301","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":23},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS1-0301","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":23}]}]}
