{"moduleCode":"MUA3228","title":"Re-imagining Pianism through Analysis","description":"This elective offers an in-depth analysis of a diverse selection of piano repertoire. Students will study elements of music such as form, harmony and texture as part of a process of internalizing and interpreting works for the piano.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"This is an elective open to Conservatory piano students and all NUS students. Students are required to be fluent in harmony (functional harmony and chromatic harmony) as the class offers an application of (rather than an introduction to) harmony. As such, NUS students would be advised to have taken either MUA 3224 or MUA 1201. For those seeking direct entry MEP study at Junior College would offer sufficient background as well. However is not a must to have experienced either of the above to be deemed as having sufficient background. Students must decide for themselves after 2 weeks of classes.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"YSTCM-SR6","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15}]}]}
