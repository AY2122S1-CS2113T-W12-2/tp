{"moduleCode":"CG2023","title":"Signals and Systems","description":"This is a fundamental course in signals and systems, specially developed for computer engineering students. Signals play an important role in carrying information. In particular the idea of frequency domain analysis of signals \nand systems are important concepts for all computer engineers. The concepts which will be covered include time and frequency domain representations, Fourier \ntransform, spectrum and bandwidth of a signal, frequency response of systems (Bode diagrams), sampling theorem, aliasing, signal reconstruction, and filtering.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computing and Engineering Programme","faculty":"Multi Disciplinary Programme","prerequisite":"MA1506 or MA1512","preclusion":"EE2023 Signals and Systems","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 27, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"02","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E3-06-08","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":70},{"classNo":"03","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":70},{"classNo":"02","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E3-06-08","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":70},{"classNo":"04","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"EA-06-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":70},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E5-03-20","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":70},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4-03-07","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40},{"classNo":"05","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E5-03-20","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":70},{"classNo":"04","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E3-06-09","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":70},{"classNo":"03","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":70},{"classNo":"03","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40},{"classNo":"02","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4-03-07","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40},{"classNo":"04","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40},{"classNo":"06","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40}]}]}
