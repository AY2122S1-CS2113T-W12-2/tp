{"moduleCode":"TS5212R","title":"Asian International Cinema","description":"In recent years, the vitality and currency of Asian cinema has resulted in texts that can no longer be viewed as merely artifacts of a particular culture or nation. This module looks at how film industries in Asia have engaged with global cinema through various forms of negotiations that assert, compromise or consume national, cultural or conventional distinctions. We assess the implications of a conglomerate Asian cinema by examining the current trend of transnational Asian films, the translatability of conventions and adaptability of ideas within Asia itself as well as between Asia and dominant cinemas like Hollywood.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate Student in the University or with the approval of the Department","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"AS4-0603","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":1}]}]}
