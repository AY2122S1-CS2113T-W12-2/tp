{"moduleCode":"YSC3206","title":"Introduction to Real Analysis","description":"This course embarks on a deep study of the real numbers and functions of a\nsingle real variable. Fundamental properties of real numbers – arithmetic,\ndistance, limit, convergence, order – are developed from scratch. From\nthere, the course delves into the inner workings of calculus, the general\nnotions of continuity, differentiability, measure, and integration, for\nfunctions of one real variable.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC2209 Proof or YSC2232 Linear Algebra or with the permission of the instructor.","preclusion":"MA2108 Mathematical Analysis I and MA3110 Mathematical Analysis II","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 24, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":180,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"Y-PgRm1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"Y-PgRm1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
