Fundamental properties of real numbers – arithmetic,\ndistance, limit, convergence, order – are developed from scratch. From\nthere, the course delves into the inner workings of calculus, the general\nnotions of continuity, differentiability, measure, and integration, for\nfunctions of one real variable.","title":"Introduction to Real Analysis","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,0,8.5],"prerequisite":"YSC2209 Proof or YSC2232 Linear Algebra or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC3206","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-PgRm1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-PgRm1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2021-11-24T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180}],"prereqTree":{"or":["YSC2209","YSC2232"]},"fulfillRequirements":["YSC4206"]}
