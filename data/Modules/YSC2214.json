{"moduleCode":"YSC2214","title":"Introduction to Optics and Imaging","description":"This course combines theoretical concepts with experimentation and\ncomputational analysis to give a solid introduction to the field of optics\nand imaging. A fundamental understanding of the nature of light, and how\nit interacts with physical systems is important for many higher level\ncourses. In this course students will learn geometrical optics, wave optics,\npolarization, interference, diffraction and how these concepts relate to\nimaging. Students will also be introduced to modern applications of optics\nthat have had a significant impact on our lives such as lasers and optical\ncommunication.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
