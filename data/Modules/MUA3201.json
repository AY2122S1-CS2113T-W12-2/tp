{"moduleCode":"MUA3201","title":"Advanced Contemporary Music Performance","description":"Students in this module rehearse and perform with OpusNovus, the conservatory’s new music ensemble.  Students will perform contemporary works for solo, chamber, and large ensemble settings. Students work with coaches in repertoire appropriate for their instrument, learning new techniques necessary for the performance of contemporary work.  Performance of learned repertoire is the main form of assessment.\n\nAs this module is an elective ensemble in which students perform contemporary solo and chamber music, they are encouraged to propose works they would like to learn in the module, planning with their respective coach an appropriate set of pieces to work on over the semester.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"YSTCM-OH","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":5},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"YSTCM-OH","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":5}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
