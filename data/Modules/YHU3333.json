{"moduleCode":"YHU3333","title":"The Arab Defeat of 1967 and its Aesthetic Afterlives","description":"Between the 5th and 10th of June 1967 Israel fought the combined forces of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. The Israeli’s swift victory not only gained them territory but shocked a transnational Arab population whose leaders had announced their military success even as their forces were decimated. “The setback,” as it was called, was “a total defeat of regimes, institutions, structures, ideas, and leaders” that upended Arabic intellectual and cultural production. This course begins with the war but then focuses on its aesthetic afterlives to ask: how does one create art in the face of total defeat?","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
