{"moduleCode":"LLJ5175V","title":"Global Legal Orders: Interdisciplinary Perspectives","description":"The development of new types of legal phenomena in the global arena has outgrown established understandings of law, and conventional classifications of legal materials. At the point of needing a theoretical underpinning for the novel concerns of academic law occasioned by globalization, fresh considerations of interdisciplinary perspectives on law are opened up, questioning the extent to which a distinctively legal approach to global issues is possible. This course engages with these challenges by exploring the global interconnectedness of law, morality, politics and economics, and considers what contribution legal theory might make to illuminating complex policy issues with a global reach.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent","preclusion":"Students who are taking or have taken LL5175.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
