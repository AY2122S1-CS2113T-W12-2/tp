{"moduleCode":"MLE4213","title":"Innovation \u0026 Product Development for Material Engineers","description":"This module provides an introduction on the innovation \u0026 product development processes that materials scientists and engineers are likely to face in their future workplaces. This course will be conducted with a mixture of MSE relevant case-studies and experiential group learning. Students will start from the pre-development process: building up their problem statements, ideation and developing their minimum viable product (product concept) by considering the technical feasibility, business viability as well as customer desirability; and then followed by development and manufacturing processes: i.e. samples development, test \u0026 certification, production etc. Continuous improvement upon product development will also be introduced.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"MLE2104 Mechanical Properties of Materials","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}]}]}
