{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Neural networks consist of input and output layers, as well as (in most cases) hidden layers consisting of interconnected units that transform the input data into an output. Their architecture makes them capable of learning and modelling nonlinear and complex relationships. In this course, participants will learn how to build and implement neural network models, and assess their performance. The versatility of neural networks is demonstrated through applications. Practical considerations about network architecture, model training and computational resources will be discussed.","title":"Learning from Data: Neural Networks","department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","workload":[5,4,0,6,5],"prerequisite":"Passed DSA5831 Learning from Data: Principles and Practice","moduleCredit":"1","moduleCode":"DSA5843","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2030","weeks":{"start":"2021-08-12","end":"2021-11-18"},"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}],"prereqTree":"DSA5831"}
