{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module is designed to equip students with the conceptual understanding and technical skills to design and construct simulations relevant to health technology assessment (HTA). After reviewing the fundamentals of modelling for HTA, the implementation of stochastic individual-level models will be addressed, including the specification and use of distributions, the structuring of these models using the DICE methodology, and the approach to analyses, interpretation and presentation.","title":"Simulation for Health Technology Assessment","department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean's Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","workload":[3,0,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SPH5423","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-01-05","end":"2022-01-05"},"venue":"MD1-08-01B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":47,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-01-03","end":"2022-01-03"},"venue":"MD1-08-01B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":47,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-01-07","end":"2022-01-07"},"venue":"MD1-08-01B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":47,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-01-06","end":"2022-01-06"},"venue":"MD1-08-01B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":47,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-01-04","end":"2022-01-04"},"venue":"MD1-08-01B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":47,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
