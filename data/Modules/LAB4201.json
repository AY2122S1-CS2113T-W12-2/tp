{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module will build on the skills developed in Bahasa Indonesia 4. Students will progress from reading selections from passages to a more sustained and systematic encounter with the nature of the language used in novels, newspapers, Internet and other forms of popular publications, official public discourse, academic writings and business Indonesian.  Students will progressively comprehend texts, not only from background and subject matter knowledge, but also from increasing control of language.  They will also learn to handle conversation involving complication, in the form of connected discourse, and to make choices of diction, as well as manipulate grammatical features reflecting formal and informal registers.\n\n\n\nLearners autonomy will be enhanced in the teaching-learning process. Students will take an active role in selecting materials and leading discussions.","title":"Bahasa Indonesia 5","department":"Centre for Language Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,2,0,3,5.5],"prerequisite":"Passed LAB3201 or placement test.
