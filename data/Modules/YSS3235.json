{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course offers an introduction to spatial visualization tools for the analysis and representation of city forms, infrastructures and social phenomena. Students will learn about the history of urban representational concepts (projection, abstraction, plan, perspective), and a number of current tools (digital model-building and plan/map representation and participatory methods). They will acquire, interrogate and manipulate digital data relevant for urban spatial analysis, and learn how to visualise data such that it effectively communicates three-dimensional urban spatial conditions. The course also introduces students to key software packages used in urban planning and design (AutoCAD, Adobe Illustrator, and Sketchup/Rhinoceros 3d modelling packages).","title":"Urban Spatial Representation","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,0,3,6,3.5],"prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3235","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YCC2121"}
