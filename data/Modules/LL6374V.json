{"moduleCode":"LL6374V","title":"Water Rights \u0026 Resources: Issues in Law \u0026 Development","description":"We will examine water’s importance to economic development and its special interest to lawyers. Water governance concerns both private as well as public\ninterests. Meanwhile, there is fundamental variation in how much is available and where. And because water flows, society must manage it across political boundaries. By drawing on the examples of a few key river basins, we will examine the reasons and processes by which water law has evolved as it has – and whether and how, given rising pressures and uncertainty, it may change.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"LL4374/LL5374/LL6374 Water Rights \u0026 Resources: Issues in Law \u0026 Development","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
