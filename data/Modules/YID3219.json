{"moduleCode":"YID3219","title":"Volcanos, Climate, and Society in the 19th Century","description":"The course examines the scientific and historical evidence for climate change associated with a pair of 19th century volcanic eruptions in modern-day Indonesia. The most famous of these eruptions is that of Krakatoa in 1883, but Tambora’s eruption in 1815 was substantially larger, as was its apparent effect on global climate.  The course will examine differences in the state of the world in 1815 and 1883 that help explain Krakatoa’s fame. We will also examine speculative claims about the social and historical impact of each eruption and its associated climate change.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
