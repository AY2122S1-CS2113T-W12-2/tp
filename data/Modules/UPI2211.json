{"moduleCode":"UPI2211","title":"Utopia: Ideal Places from Plato to the Smart City","description":"From the ancient world to the present day, philosophers, novelists, and social thinkers have attempted to envision ideal states. Utopian texts often present us with provocative thought experiments, addressing fundamental questions about justice, leadership, and human flourishing. In this module, we will critically examine representations of ideal states ranging from Plato\u0027s Republic to contemporary visions about smart cities. We will focus in particular on the roles of governance, labor, and technology in the construction of utopian projects and discuss whether the utopian imagination is still relevant in the present day.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","prerequisite":"Not applicable","preclusion":"Not applicable","corequisite":"Not applicable","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"UTSRC-GLR","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"UTSRC-GLR","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30}]}]}
