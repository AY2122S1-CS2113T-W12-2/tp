{"moduleCode":"ST5203","title":"Design of Experiments for Product Design and Process Improvements","description":"The module introduces designed experiment as a tool for process improvements and designing products that are robust to environmental variability. Inferences about the effect of factors on a product or process can be drawn using designed experiment. Topics include analysis of variance of fixed-effect models, randomized block design, factorial designs, fractional factorial designs, blocking and confounding, response surface methodology, random effects models, nested and split-plot designs. Predictive analytics using designed experiments. This module is targeted at students who are interested in designing robust products and process improvements, and are able to meet the pre-requisites.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Departmental approval","preclusion":"ST5318","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Dec 2, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1900,"endTime":2200,"venue":"E-Hybrid_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":300}]}]}
