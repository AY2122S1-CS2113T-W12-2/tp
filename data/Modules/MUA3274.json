{"moduleCode":"MUA3274","title":"Sonic Environments","description":"This course will investigate the changing relationships between humans and their surrounding sonic environments. Students will gain an understanding of the effects of the sonic environment on the human species, as individuals and as larger societies, and the ways in which humans are in turn responsible for drastic changes in the sonic environment, primarily since the advent of electronic and electroacoustic media technology. Another component of the module will be individual and group creative and research projects documenting the local sonic environment, accompanied by analytical essays. The semester will culminate in public presentations of all projects.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"YSTCM-SR3","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15}]}]}
