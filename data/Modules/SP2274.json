{"moduleCode":"SP2274","title":"Engineering a Life-like Cell","description":"This module introduces students to the possibility of constructing the smallest unit of life, the cell. Using the central question, what are the minimum components and processes required to build an artificial living cell from scratch, students will explore how the fundamental chemical and physical principles underlying several biological processes which cells can integrate and function as an autonomous machine to self-replicate, self-assembly, self-repair and reprogram can respond to changes in the environment.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoS Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Pass in any two of the following GCE ‘A’-level /H2 subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, either Mathematics or Further Mathematics; or equivalent.","preclusion":"SP2171, SP2173 and SP2174","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"LT26","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"3","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"SPSWETLAB","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"SPSWETLAB","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"SPSWETLAB","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"SPSWETLAB","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"LT26","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT26","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
