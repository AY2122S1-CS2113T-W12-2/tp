{"moduleCode":"YHU2313","title":"Introduction to the Philosophy of Art","description":"How might one go about answering the question ‘What is Art?’? Should we look at the style of the work, the intention of the artist, the zietgeist, or millieu? Or should we simply identify as a work of Art any and every thing that anyone has called Art in the relevant period? This course introduces students to the history of the philosophy of art, and gives them an overview of the key questions and theories, raised by philosophers, poets, painters and writers of literature, that have shaped the field and that direct both our experience and our understanding of Art.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1430,"venue":"Y-CR16","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1430,"venue":"Y-CR16","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
