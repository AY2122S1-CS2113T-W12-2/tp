{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"CN4122 Process Synthesis and Simulation","description":"This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical processes. This module is only available to non-graduating students, by invitation from the Department.","title":"Process Synthesis and Simulation","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2,2,0,4,2],"prerequisite":"Host department will access whether students meet pre-requisite on a case-by-case basis.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CN4122N","aliases":["CN4122"],"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"5","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"7","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2-0306PC3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2-0306PC3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-02","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":10,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-04-27T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
