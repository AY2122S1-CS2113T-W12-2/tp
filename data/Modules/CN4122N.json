{"moduleCode":"CN4122N","title":"Process Synthesis and Simulation","description":"This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical processes. This module is only available to non-graduating students, by invitation from the Department.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Host department will access whether students meet pre-requisite on a case-by-case basis.","preclusion":"CN4122 Process Synthesis and Simulation","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10},{"classNo":"5","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10},{"classNo":"7","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1100,"endTime":1300,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20}]},{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 27, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E2-0306PC3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E2-0306PC3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1100,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EA-06-02","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":10}]}]}
