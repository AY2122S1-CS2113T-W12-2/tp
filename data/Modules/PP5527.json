{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course introduces game theoretic tools to examine strategic behavior and its consequences for a wide range of economic, political, and social applications. We develop important techniques to better navigate strategic interactions from decision-making under risk and uncertainty, collective decision-making, agenda setting and strategic voting, negotiating and bargaining, the value of common knowledge, information disclosure with signaling and screening, participating in auctions, and designing strategyproof mechanisms in practice. We also highlight the limitations of rationality in practice and develop strategic analysis and institutional design techniques in light of individual/collective decision-making given such empirical (ir-)regularities from behavioral economics.","title":"Game Theory and Strategic Decision-Making","department":"LKYSPP Dean's Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PP5527","semesterData":[]}
