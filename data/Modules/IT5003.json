{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module introduces non-computing students to efficient computational problem solving in an accelerated pace. Students will learn to formulate a computational problem, identify the data required and come up with appropriate data structures to represent them, and apply known strategies to design an algorithm to solve the problem. Students will also learn to quantify the space and time complexity of an algorithm, prove the correctness of an algorithm, and the limits of computation. Topics include common data structures and their algorithms (lists, hash tables, heap, trees, graphs), algorithmic problem solving paradigms (greedy, divide and conquer, dynamic programming), and NP-completeness.","title":"Data Structures and Algorithms","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,1,2,3,2],"corequisite":"IT5001","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"IT5003","attributes":{"lab":true,"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":{"start":"2021-10-09","end":"2021-11-27"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":200,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2030","weeks":{"start":"2021-10-06","end":"2021-11-24"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":200,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"5","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":{"start":"2021-10-09","end":"2021-11-27"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"6","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":{"start":"2021-10-09","end":"2021-11-27"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":{"start":"2021-10-09","end":"2021-11-27"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":{"start":"2021-10-09","end":"2021-11-27"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2021-10-04","end":"2021-11-22"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":80,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":{"start":"2021-10-04","end":"2021-11-22"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":80,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"7","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":{"start":"2021-10-09","end":"2021-11-27"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-12-04T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":{"start":"2022-03-12","end":"2022-04-30"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":{"start":"2022-03-14","end":"2022-05-02"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-03-14","end":"2022-05-02"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2030","weeks":{"start":"2022-03-09","end":"2022-04-27"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":{"start":"2022-03-12","end":"2022-04-30"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2022-05-07T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"fulfillRequirements":["IT5007"]}
