{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Bioimaging is one of the major emerging research areas in biological research due to the wide range of methods available with excellent temporal and spatial resolution. This allows us nowadays to test biological events at both the cellular and single molecule level. The module aims at introducing the interested student to the practical basis to achieve good images in both light microscopy and electron microscopy. Students will perform hands-on experiments on the different microscopes in the Centre of Bioimaging Sciences and will get a basic training to allow them to take images and perform basic data analysis independently.","title":"Practical Bioimaging A: Light & Electron Microscopy","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[1,0,3,0,6],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"BL5232A","semesterData":[]}
