{"moduleCode":"ME3211","title":"Mechanics Of Solids","description":"The module covers topics on: Linear elasticity in which the general equations of equilibrium and compatibility are derived and its applications are illustrated for complex problems; Unsymmetrical bending of beams; Stresses in pressurized thick-walled cylinders in elastic and elasto-plastic regions; Stresses in rotating members; Introduction to mechanics of composite materials; and Experimental stress analysis with particular emphasis on optical methods. This is an elective module and is intended for students in Stage 3 and 4 who have an interest in the stress analysis of isotropic and composite materials. The materials in this module are applicable to chemical, civil, mechanical and aeronautical engineering.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"ME2112","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 23, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}]}]}
