{"moduleCode":"YSS3323","title":"Statelessness: Law, History, Politics","description":"Instances of statelessness and refugeedom dominate headlines today. But what does “statelessness” mean? Rather than solely focusing on contemporary doctrinal interpretations of statelessness, this course emphasizes twentieth century global, regional, and national histories within which statelessness emerged as a political and legal category. We reflect on limits of refugee regimes in the historical context of South and Southeast Asia. Engaging judgments, treaties, oral history, videos, and images, we explore postwar displacement, decolonization, reconstruction and emerging Cold War tensions in these regions. Finally, we also discuss ethical and political issues at stake in writing about statelessness.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSS2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
