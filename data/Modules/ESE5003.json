{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"ESE6003","description":"This module provides students with a strong foundation in environmental chemical principles for environmental engineering and science, with primary focus on natural and engineered processes and systems. The topics include chemical background, properties of soils, chemical equilibrium and thermodynamics, acid/base reaction, CO2 system, coordination chemistry, metal-ligand interaction, precipitation, adsorption, ion exchange, colloid, and organic geochemistry. MINEQL, a chemical equilibrium software, will be taught in this module. Upon the completion, students will be better equipped with knowledge in environmental chemistry to quantitatively understand and solve various environmental problems.","title":"Environmental Chemical Processes Analysis","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ESE5003","attributes":{"grsu":true,"lab":true},"semesterData":[],"fulfillRequirements":["ESE5608"]}
