{"moduleCode":"CM4251","title":"Characterization Techniques in Materials Chemistry","description":"Preparation and characterization of materials form crucial  and vital aspects of materials research. Highly developed instruments are now available to apply an interdisciplinary study to understand the structure-property relationship. This module provides undergraduates an introduction to modern materials characterization techniques which comprise surface analysis techniques, X-ray diffraction,  microscopy, thermal analyses, mechanical tastings and spectroscopies.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM3252 or CM3253","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}]}]}
