{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Freshwater ecosystems are extremely important habitats, housing vast species diversity and providing potable water, energy (hydro-electric dams) and revenue (fisheries) for the global population. With impending threats of urban development, climate change, pollution and invasive species, freshwater conservation is vital to maintaining the health and function of these ecosystems. This module will include hands-on use of conservation tools, case studies of current freshwater conservation projects, designing biomonitoring for conservation outcomes and future challenges to freshwater conservation. Effective freshwater management approaches will also be covered with possible applications for understudied regions.","title":"Freshwater Conservation","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,0,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"BL5311","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0307","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
