{"moduleCode":"ME6304","title":"Turbulence in Fluid Flows","description":"This is an advanced course dealing with various physical and dynamical aspects of turbulence. It covers mean flow equations, isotropic turbulence and their properties, length scales and their determination, transport processes, coherent structures, and structures of wall-bounded and free-shear flows. Statistical tools used in the description of turbulence as well as the measurement techniques and experimental details to measure various flow parameters will be adequately covered. Mathematical turbulence models will be briefly discussed.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
