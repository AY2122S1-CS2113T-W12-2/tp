{"moduleCode":"GE4226","title":"Mobile Spaces: Making Social Worlds","description":"This module offers students theoretical and applied understandings of mobilities as a productive site of social life and culture. Drawing perspectives from the ‘new’ mobilities paradigm, it demonstrates how movement is not a sterile activity or zone, but a space replete with meaning. To exemplify this point, this course takes transportation as a lens of analysis, and interrogates its socio?cultural organization and experience. Three aspects will be emphasized, namely the identities and embodiments latent in transportation; the infrastructures of transit; and the (geo)politics of mobility. Case studies will be drawn internationally, including Asia.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed at least 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track. \n\n(Global Studies students) Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed at least 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 29, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"AS5-0202","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
