{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module examines historically significant\nsculptures, architecture and paintings that are\nproduced in Southeast Asia and span the timeframe of\nabout one thousand years. It surveys artistic fields\nshaped by Hindu-Buddhist ideals. These testify to the\ncreative, technological capacities of designers and\ncommunities of artists, as well as the ambitions and\nresources of patrons. They also reveal links within the\nregion, and connections with India. The module\ncultivates methods for analysing the composition and\nformation of images, designs and built forms, gaining\nunderstanding of their symbolic import, and fostering\ninsights into complex relationships between religious\nideals and their artistic representations.","title":"Art in Southeast Asia, 4th-14th centuries CE","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"AH2101","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"AH2204","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS8-0401","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS6-0214","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS6-0214","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":"AH2101"}
