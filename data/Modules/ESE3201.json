{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module equips students with fundamental knowledge of dynamic atmospheric air quality in a changing world. The topics cover the effects of emission sources and pollutants, air quality assessment, atmospheric reactions of air pollutants, principles and implications of vertical mixing and transport of airborne pollutants, and air pollution control strategies and devices. The module aims to enable students to understand dynamic atmospheric processes and to identify air pollution issues associated with varied energy sources and economic development. Students will also learn to assess air quality, quantify air pollutant levels, devise control strategies and recommend engineering solutions to enhance air quality.","title":"Air Quality in Changing Environments","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,1,0,0.5,5.5],"prerequisite":"ESE2 standing or equivalent","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ESE3201","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"02","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EW2-03-14","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":35,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EW2-03-14","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":35,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-03","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":70,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"02","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-03","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":70,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-03","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2021-11-23T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"fulfillRequirements":["ESE4407","ESE4409"]}
