{"moduleCode":"GE2102","title":"Politics, Economies And Space","description":"This compulsory module provides an introduction to political and economic geography, and serves as a gateway to more specialised level 3000 and 4000 modules in these fields. It advances two key arguments, namely that politics and the economy are (1) tightly intertwined and (2) innately geographical phenomenon. It explores how politics, the economy and the environment are constituted through different sets of actors and their interrelationships. It mobilises core geographical concepts, notably place, space, scale and territory, along with notions of power and resistance, to offer a distinctive perspective on processes of uneven development in the contemporary world.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GE2202 Economy and Space or GE2222 Politics and Space","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 25, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"LT11","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":200},{"classNo":"E6","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"E7","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"E5","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}]}]}
