In this era of globalization, many state and individual activities in many countries are direct results of treaty obligations. In this sense, treaties are the “overworked workhorses” of the global legal order.\n\nDespite this significant impact on our lives, few of us understand what treaties truly mean and what kinds of implications they bring to international relations, our businesses, and private lives. In order to understand the treaty mechanisms, this course covers various aspects of the law of treaties.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
