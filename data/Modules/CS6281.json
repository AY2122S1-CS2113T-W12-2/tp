{"moduleCode":"CS6281","title":"Topics in Computer Science: Immersive Videos","description":"This seminar-style module explores the state-of-the-art advances and open research challenges in immersive videos, including free-viewpoint videos, 360-degree videos, volumetric videos, and light field videos. Discussions will focus on both algorithmic techniques and systems approaches to represent, compress, transmit, and render immersive immersive videos. Issues related to user experiences when interacting with immersive videos will also be discussed. This module aims to prepare graduate students interested in research and development in the intersection of multimedia processing, user interaction/experience, and networking systems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms and (ST2334 Probability and Statistics or ST2131 Probability)","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"LT15","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
