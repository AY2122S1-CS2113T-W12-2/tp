{"moduleCode":"JS3227","title":"Entrepreneurship : Self-Made in Japan","description":"Entrepreneurship is one of the main factors determining the dynamics of a country\u0027s economy.  However, Japan has been described as a collectivist society where individual initiative is not appreciated and where it was often the government that led economic development.  Yet, Japan has produced a number of extraordinary individuals who played an important role in shaping its economy.  Through a series of case studies of dynamic and colourful entrepreneurship the module aims to identify the forces underlying entrepreneurship in Japan, thereby creating a general understanding of the interaction between the individual and its economic, political and social environment.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Japanese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 4, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"AS8-0402","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30}]}]}
