{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Entrepreneurship is one of the main factors determining the dynamics of a country's economy.  However, Japan has been described as a collectivist society where individual initiative is not appreciated and where it was often the government that led economic development.  Yet, Japan has produced a number of extraordinary individuals who played an important role in shaping its economy.  Through a series of case studies of dynamic and colourful entrepreneurship the module aims to identify the forces underlying entrepreneurship in Japan, thereby creating a general understanding of the interaction between the individual and its economic, political and social environment.","title":"Entrepreneurship : Self-Made in Japan","department":"Japanese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"JS3227","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS8-0402","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-04T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
