{"moduleCode":"RVC1000","title":"How in the world do we get along?","description":"Our world is figuratively shrinking. We increasingly encounter people who are different from us, such as in the areas of cultural backgrounds, language, religion, and values. We have to navigate these differences in our communities and workplace, and doing so requires us to effectively connect with people and work across cultures. With a focus on Emotional Intelligence (EI) and Cultural Intelligence (CI), this module empowers one to gain greater appreciation of cultural diversity and enhanced agility in collaborating and communicating in cross-cultural\nsettings.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Ridge View Residential College","faculty":"Residential College","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"G5","startTime":1000,"endTime":1300,"venue":"RVR-MPR01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18},{"classNo":"G6","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"RVR-MPR01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18},{"classNo":"G1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1300,"venue":"RVR-MPR01","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18},{"classNo":"G2","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"RVR-MPR01","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18},{"classNo":"G3","startTime":1000,"endTime":1300,"venue":"RVR-MPR01","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18},{"classNo":"G4","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"RVR-MPR01","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18}]}]}
