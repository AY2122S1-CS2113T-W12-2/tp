{"moduleCode":"PC1431X","title":"Physics IE","description":"The module is designed to provide a clear and logical introduction to the concepts and principles of mechanics and thermodynamics, with illustrations based on applications to the real world. Topics covered include motion in one dimension; curvilinear motion; circular motion; relative motion; Newton\u0027s laws; friction; work and energy; conservative forces, conservation of energy; linear momentum and conservation, collisions; rotational kinematics; moment of inertia and torque; rotational dynamics; conservation of angular momentum; temperature and the zeroth law, temperature scales; heat and internal energy, specific heat capacities, work for ideal gases, first law of thermodynamics; equipartition of energy, entropy and the second law, heat engines; entropy changes for reversible and irreversible processes. The module is targeted essentially at Engineering students.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students from FOE (i.e. Civil Eng, Environmental Eng,  Common Engineering, Mechanical Eng, Bioengineering, Industrial \u0026 Systems Eng and Material Science \u0026 Eng) with ‘A’ level or H2 pass in Physics; or \u0027A\u0027 level or H2 pass in Physics","preclusion":"Students majoring in Physics.
