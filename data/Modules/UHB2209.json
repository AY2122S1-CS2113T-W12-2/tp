Through a combination of academic work and case studies, the module explores\n(i)\tunder what circumstances, and how, governance in the modern world needs to be more “polycentric” – taking place at multiple interlocking levels, including the global, national and local; \n(ii)\tkey determinants of success or failure in different instances of polycentricity; \n(iii)\tboth the benefits and limitations inherent in polycentric governance arrangements, as well as the challenges and obstacles to achieving greater polycentricity.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
