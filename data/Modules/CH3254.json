This module will trace the origins and development of Neo-Confucianism within the political, social and cultural context of the last thousand year of imperial China’s history. It will allow students to see the complexity that accompanied the spread of Neo-Confucianism in history. It is intended for students who are interested in studying Chinese thought from a historical perspective.","title":"Neo-Confucianism in Chinese History","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"1) At least a B4 for GCE ‘O’ level Chinese or Higher Chinese; OR  \n2) A pass in GCE ‘A’ level H1 Chinese or H2 Chinese; OR \n3) Equivalent qualifications may be accepted.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CH3254","semesterData":[]}
