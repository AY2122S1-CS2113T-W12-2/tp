{"moduleCode":"CH3254","title":"Neo-Confucianism in Chinese History","description":"In the eleventh century, a new intellectual movement that we retrospectively called Neo-Confucianism began to take shape and after a few centuries of intense competition with other intellectual trends, it became the orthodoxy of the late imperial system. This module will trace the origins and development of Neo-Confucianism within the political, social and cultural context of the last thousand year of imperial China’s history. It will allow students to see the complexity that accompanied the spread of Neo-Confucianism in history. It is intended for students who are interested in studying Chinese thought from a historical perspective.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"1) At least a B4 for GCE ‘O’ level Chinese or Higher Chinese; OR  \n2) A pass in GCE ‘A’ level H1 Chinese or H2 Chinese; OR \n3) Equivalent qualifications may be accepted.","preclusion":"Students who have read CH3253 Confucian Thought.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
