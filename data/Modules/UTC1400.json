{"moduleCode":"UTC1400","title":"Debating Singapore\u0027s Social and Economic History","description":"This module challenges today’s generation of students to reexamine and debate some of the foundational myths and assumptions about Singapore’s pioneer past. The timespan covers Singapore’s founding as a colonial economic “place” in 1819, the events leading to postcolonial independence in 1959–1965, and the formation of communities into a “nation”. We will focus on the interplay of global economic factors with internal social factors, and challenge students to ask how the engagement of communities and community leaders impacts economic development.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
