{"moduleCode":"SC4202","title":"Reading Ethnographies","description":"Ethnography involves doing fieldwork and writing about it. We examine the tensions between fieldwork, the crafting of the ethnographic text, and its reception within the discipline of anthropology. Following the ‘writing culture\u0027 debate, we aim to understand how ethnographers ‘construct\u0027 data, frame their analysis, and produce a text. We examine ethnographic ‘realism\u0027 as a style, how styles have changed over time, and how differently some researchers have written about the same culture area. The course will heighten students\u0027 critical skills and their awareness of how any representation of social reality has been put together.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC or 28 MCs in MS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the\nHonours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":55}]}]}
