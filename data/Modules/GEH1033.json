{"moduleCode":"GEH1033","title":"How the Ocean Works","description":"About three-quarters of the surface of our home, the Earth, is covered by an ocean of water! The ocean is inseparably intertwined with human settlements. Day in, day out, directly, indirectly - from the air that we breathe to climate change, trade, politics or social holidays - the presence and the influence of the ocean is undeniable on the human society. We will discuss how the ocean is connected to our lives, how the various ocean phenomena affect our lives and our attempts at controlling and exploiting the ocean. Students will gain an appreciation of the scientific principles involved. This course will also help us make educated decisions about our environment and our ocean, so that future generations may also enjoy the majesty of our blue planet, as we do now.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","preclusion":"GEK1548,GEK1548FC","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":200},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":200}]}]}
