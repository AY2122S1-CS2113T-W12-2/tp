{"moduleCode":"GEC1033","title":"Maverick or Mahatma? Gandhi’s Life \u0026 Legacy","description":"This module will examine the life and writings of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, regarded as one of the icons of the twentieth century and one of the principal architects of a free India. The course is meant to not only understand and analyse Gandhi’s thought but also to outline his extraordinary legacy. The course will introduce students to Gandhi’s writings and ideas on several issues, including non-violence, colonialism, modernity, ethics, science and health. The aim would be to not only expose students to the complexity of Gandhi — the man and his ideas — but to critically interrogate Gandhi and his legacies.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GEK1048, GET1009","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS4-0114","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS2-0413","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS3-0305","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15}]}]}
