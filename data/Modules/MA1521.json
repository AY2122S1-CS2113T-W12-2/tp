{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"Students reading a primary major in Mathematics/Applied Mathematics/Quantitative Finance/Data Science and Analytics, MA1102R, MA1312, MA1505, MA1507, MA2002, MA2501, FoE students, YSC1216","description":"This module provides a basic foundation for calculus and its related subjects required by computing students. The objective is to train the students to be able to handle calculus techniques arising in their courses of specialization. In addition to the standard calculus material, the course also covers simple mathematical modeling techniques and numerical methods in connection with ordinary differential equations. \n\n\n\nMajor topics: \n\nPreliminaries on sets and number systems. \n\nCalculus of functions of one variable and applications. \n\nSequences, series and power series.   \n\nFunctions of several variables. Extrema.\n\nFirst and second order differential equations. \n\nBasic numerical methods for ordinary differential equations.","title":"Calculus for Computing","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"GCE ‘A’ Level Mathematics or H2 Mathematics or H2 Further Mathematics or MA1301 or MA1301X","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MA1521","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":900,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":900,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"5","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"6","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"7","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"8","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"9","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"10","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":900,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":900,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"5","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0404","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"6","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0404","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0404","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0611","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0404","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0611","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["Unknown","B"],"examDate":"2022-04-29T06:30:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["MA1301","MA1301X"]},"fulfillRequirements":["DSC3214","CS3244","CS4243","CS4248","CS5240","CS5241","CS5249","CS3242","CS4347","CS5343","CS3218","CS5332","IT3011","CS4278","CS5478","BT2101","BT4240","IS4242","MA1104","MA1506","MA2108","MA2108S","MA2213","MA2311","MA2312","MA3220","QF3101","MA2216","MA2104","ST2334","ST2131","CS2109S"]}
