{"moduleCode":"CM3242","title":"Instrumental Analysis II","description":"Instrumentation-based analytic techniques are essential for research \u0026 development, and for process/product control in manufacturing. These techniques are widely deployed in the chemicals, electronics and other manufacturing industries. Students will learn the principles, instrumentation and applications of the key analytical techniques including atomic and molecular spectrometries, basic mass spectrometry, electrochemical and thermal analysis methods. Students will also learn the extraction and separation techniques for sample preparation needed for these analyses. Students will also receive in-depth hands on training in selected techniques.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM2142 or CM2192 or LSM2191 or Department approval","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 29, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":180},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1100,"endTime":1200,"venue":"S5-0224","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":180},{"classNo":"2","startTime":800,"endTime":900,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1700,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S8-0314","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"4","startTime":900,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}]}]}
