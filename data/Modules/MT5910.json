{"moduleCode":"MT5910","title":"LaunchPad: Experiential Entrepreneurship","description":"LaunchPad is a unique action learning project that assembles cross-disciplinary teams of graduate and Ph.D. students from the Faculty of Engineering \u0026 School of Business. Each team will work with a selected technology developed at NUS that has a promise to generate a large market impact. The students will learn how to actually start a high-tech company based on a particular technology. This course is NOT about how to write a business plan or create a presentation for VCs. It’s about taking action - talking to customers, partners, competitors in search for the right market and the right business model that can leverage the uniqueness of a technology. It’s about\nexperiencing the typical creative start-up process that is often full of uncertainty to turn a new technology into a great company.","moduleCredit":8.0,"department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"MT5900 MOT Research Project\nSDM5990 SDM Research Project","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
