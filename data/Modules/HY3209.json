Apart from the international challenges posed by the Second World War and the subsequent Cold War, the European states were also beset by numerous acute domestic crises that required remedial treatment by their governments. Some received it and prospered, others did not and languished.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"EU3230","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
