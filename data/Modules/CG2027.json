{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Building on the basic circuit concepts introduced through CG1111 and CG1112, this module introduces the fundamental concept of carriers, operating principles of PN diodes and MOSFETs. Their IV characteristic in different operating region and their impact on the performance of logic gate will also be discussed. It explains the foundational concepts of inverters and analyses their performance in terms of power and delay trade-off. It also introduces logic synthesis and the fundamental timing analysis of logic gates. Besides the\nstatic CMOS logic, it will also cover pass logics or transmission gates logics.","title":"Transistor-level Digital Circuits","department":"Computing and Engineering Programme","faculty":"Multi Disciplinary Programme","workload":"1.5-0.5-0-0-3-5","prerequisite":"CG1111A OR CG1111 OR EE1111B OR EE2111A","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"CG2027","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6],"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"02","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6],"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"03","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6],"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"04","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6],"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"02","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6],"venue":"E3-06-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":27,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"03","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6],"venue":"E3-06-01","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":27,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6],"venue":"E1-06-08","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6],"venue":"E3-06-01","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":27,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["CG1111A","CG1111","EE1111B","EE2111A"]},"fulfillRequirements":["EE3431C"]}
