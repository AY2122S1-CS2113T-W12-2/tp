{"moduleCode":"UPI2214","title":"Multidisciplinary Inquiries Into the Mystery of “Minds”","description":"What is “the mind” and where does it fit in the interdependent histories of nature and culture on our planet? Does “mind” reduce to brain activity – or is it more than just the electro-chemical exchange between neurons? As minded creatures with brains ourselves, the ways in which we delimit the mind/brain relation has enormous consequences for the ongoing construction of our legal, social, medical and ethical lives. In this module, we will study some of the major approaches to this issue, and attempt to discover what it is that we are really talking about when we are talking about “mind.”","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","preclusion":"UWC2101R Writing \u0026 Critical Thinking: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on “Mind”","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
