{"moduleCode":"CE5108A","title":"Lateral Earth Pressures and Retaining Wall Design via Eurocode 7","description":"Together with “CE5108B Deep Excavations Design Using Eurocode 7”, this is an advanced module in earth?retaining structures and deep excavations.\n\nTopics include earth pressure theories, rigid retaining structures, flexible retaining structures, cellular cofferdams, retaining walls for deep excavations, support systems for deep excavations, and field monitoring. Participants are taught to deal with design and construction issues pertaining to a spectrum of earth?retaining systems from low rigid retaining walls to flexible support systems for deep excavations. They will also learn to apply the methods\nof limit state, such as BS8002 and Eurocode7, to the design of rigid and flexible retaining walls.\n\nApplications of commercial geotechnical FEM softwares are taught to aid in design of deep excavations to limit ground deformations and satisfy SLS requirements. \nAt the end of the course, participants are taught the application\nof advanced earth pressure theories, selection of appropriate\nretaining structures, and verification of capacity and movement\nrequirements, using limit equilibrium and FEM analysis tools.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Background in soil mechanics or equivalent","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":4,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"LT6","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"01","startTime":930,"endTime":1330,"venue":"LT6","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}]}]}
