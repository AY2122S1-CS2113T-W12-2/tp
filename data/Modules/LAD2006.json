{"moduleCode":"LAD2006","title":"LAD2006 Design 3","description":"This course applies principles of landscape design that respond to a site-specific project. Work in the studio introduces to students the core design processes including site analysis, design strategies, design development, and visualization. The assigned project will require botanical knowledge, as well as knowledge of topics related to tropicality (extreme heat, hot \u0026 humid) and tropical ecology (high level of heterogeneity, dynamic growth of plants). The module will also introduce problem-solving techniques using a systemic thinking process. The module will simultaneously include hands-on gardening activities on the university campus.","moduleCredit":8.0,"department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","prerequisite":"Min C grade for LAD1001 Design 1 and LAD1002/LAD1005 Design 2","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1800,"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
