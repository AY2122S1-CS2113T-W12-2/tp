{"moduleCode":"CS5343","title":"Advanced Computer Animation","description":"From the covert digital water in Titanic to the mixed real and virtual actors in Avatar, from the arm-controllable Wii games to the completely full-body-play Xbox Kinect games, computer animation technologies have advanced significantly during the past decades, both in the movie and the game industries. This module reveals all the exciting behind-the-scene techniques that make these movies and games possible, including but not limited to motion capture, fluid animation, facial animation, and fullbody character animation. This is a project-based course that aims to provide strong foundation on advanced computer animation methods and prepare students for research in animation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"(CS2010 or CS2020 or ((CS2030 or its equivalent) or CS2113/T) and (CS2040 or its equivalent)) and (MA1101R or MA1506) and (MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1505C or MA1521) and CS3241","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
