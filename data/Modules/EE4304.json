{"moduleCode":"EE4304","title":"Digital Control Systems","description":"This module provides students with system theory, analysis tools and design methods in discrete-time domain. It is the first course in control and automation that systematically introduces the basic concepts and principles in sampling, Z-transform, zero-order-hold, discrete equivalence and the relations to discrete-time control design. It further examines the design issues for digital PID, PID auto-tuning, phase compensator, and the model predictive control, including the performance criteria, pole-placement, as well as numerous illustrative application examples.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"EE2010\nEE3331C","preclusion":"EE3304.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
