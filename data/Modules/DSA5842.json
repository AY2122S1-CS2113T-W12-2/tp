{"moduleCode":"DSA5842","title":"Learning from Data: Support Vector Machines","description":"Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods widely used for classification. An SVM discriminates between two classes by generating a decision boundary that optimally separates classes after transforming the input data into a high-dimensional space. SVMs are popular because they are memory efficient and can address a large number of predictor variables. In this course, participants will learn how to build and implement SVMs, and assess their performance. The versatility of SVMs is demonstrated through practical applications.","moduleCredit":1.0,"department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Passed DSA5831 Learning from Data: Principles and Practice","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1900,"endTime":2030,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}]}]}
