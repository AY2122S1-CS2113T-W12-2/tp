{"moduleCode":"BZD6012","title":"Experimental Methods for Behavioral Research","description":"This course is aimed at doctoral students who intend to conduct experimental and quasi-experimental research for the study of individuals’ behavior in business (e.g., marketing, organizational behavior) and related disciplines (e.g., psychology). Topics include factorial designs, repeated (within-subject) and mixed designs, analysis of covariance, and mediation analysis. Importantly, the course examines these designs and analyses from the perspective of an applied behavioral researcher, not from that of a statistician. That is, the course emphasizes the actual use of proper data collection procedures and analyses techniques for rigorous theory testing instead of focusing on statistical theory per se.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"BIZ1-SR6-4","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15}]}]}
