{"moduleCode":"LL6330","title":"Advanced Trusts Law","description":"The first part of the course explores how trusts are used to manage family wealth, with emphasis on developments in the ‘offshore world’. We will discuss how trusts may be used to  protect  assets,  how  trustees’  discretions  may  be controlled, the rights of objects of trusts, and purpose trusts. The   second   part   concerns   trusts   in   commercial transactions.  We  will  explore  creditor  trusts,  constructive trusts,  bonds  and  intermediated  holding  of  securities, equitable   assignments  and  equitable  charges.  By comparing commercial trusts with private trusts, we will also ask whether there are any significant contextual differences in relation to the trust device.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"LL4330V/LL5330V/LL6330V Advanced Trusts Law","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
