{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module develops the foundations of human microscopic anatomy essential for research or clinical applications. It covers the visualization of biomolecules in tissues of the body. Interpretation of images occurs in the context of knowledge about the normal microscopic anatomy of different tissues and organs of the human body. Suitable clinical problems will be introduced throughout the course to show the application of scientific knowledge.","title":"Human Microscopic Anatomy","department":"Anatomy","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,0,1,0,6],"prerequisite":"LSM1102 Molecular Genetics or LSM1106 Molecular Cell Biology (AY2021/22 to AY2023/24)\nLSM2105 Molecular Genetics or LSM2106 Fundamental Biochemistry (AY2024/25 onwards)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LSM4236","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S2-0415","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S2-0414","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-04-28T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
