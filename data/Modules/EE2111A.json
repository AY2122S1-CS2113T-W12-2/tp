{"moduleCode":"EE2111A","title":"Electrical Engineering Principles and Practice II","description":"This module is the second part of the two part module\nEngineering Principles and Practice (EPP) I and II and\nfollows closely the same learning objectives. Most modern\nengineering systems are more electric. They convert some\nraw form of energy, such as fuel, mechanical or energy\nstored in battery, into electrical form. We see this in every\nengineering system from trains, biomedical devices,\nchemical plants, electric cars, aircrafts and ships to ICT\ndevices such as computers, handphones, tablets etc.\nHence, energy conversion, distribution, and sensing \u0026\ncontrol will form the backbone of this knowledge segment.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"EG1112/ME2104, CG1111, EE1112","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4A-06-03","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":75},{"classNo":"02","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4A-06-03","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":75},{"classNo":"02","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4A-06-03","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":75},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4A-06-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":75},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1200,"endTime":1201,"venue":"ENG-AUD","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":220}]}]}
