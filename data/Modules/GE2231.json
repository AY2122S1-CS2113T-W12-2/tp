{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Living Space introduces students to the idea that space is lived and experienced as part social and cultural life. Drawing from the arts, food, sports and film, and/or other related topics, the module delves into critical developments in social and cultural geography, providing students with the foundational knowledge and required grounding to read advanced courses in the sub-discipline.
