{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Touchpoints are periods, during the first years of life during which child’s spurts in development result in a disruption in the family. The succession of touchpoints in a child’s development functions as a map that can be identified and anticipated by both parents and care providers. As parents benefit from affirmation of their child’s development and the nurturing environment they have provided for their child, this short intensive 3-day module teaches healthcare professionals caregiving themes that matter to parents (as opposed to traditional milestones). It will develop a model of practice that establishes collaborative relationships with families presenting to primary healthcare, laying the foundation for strong family bonds.","title":"Early Childhood Development","department":"Division of Graduate Medical Studies","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","prerequisite":"(1) M.B.B.S. degree or equivalent\n(2) At least 2 years post-registration\n(3) English language requirement: applicants whose native\ntongue or medium of undergraduate instruction is not\nEnglish must fulfil a minimum level of English proficiency","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"CAH5104","semesterData":[]}
