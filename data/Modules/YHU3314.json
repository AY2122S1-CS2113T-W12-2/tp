{"moduleCode":"YHU3314","title":"1989: The End of the Cold War","description":"This course on the global history of 1989 provides an in-depth understanding of rapid historical change. Within a matter of few months, the Soviet empire collapsed, seemingly out of the blue, precipitating changes in America, Eastern Europe, China, and beyond. Why do empires crumble and how do ordinary people react? What caused this momentous historical change: savvy diplomats, philosophers, shortage of natural resources, or movements of civil society? We will study transcripts of Soviet party leadership meetings, trials of communist dictators, and secondary literature with a global reach to make sense of the end of the Cold War.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
