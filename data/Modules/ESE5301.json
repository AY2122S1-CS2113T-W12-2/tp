{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"ESE6301","description":"This module provides students with a strong foundation in biological principles for environmental engineering, with primary focus on natural biological processes. After an overview of biological principles and classification, the module emphasizes on microbial nutrition and growth, inhibition and control of growth, growth energetics, metabolic pathways, biochemistry of key enzymes, wastewater microbiology, microbial genetics. Through the discussion, students can better understand why biological processes are expected to function in biologically related processes and how their performance may be implemented.","title":"Environmental Microbiology and Biotechnology","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0,0,5,2],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ESE5301","attributes":{"grsu":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":71,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-11-26T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":90}]}
