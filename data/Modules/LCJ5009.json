Engaging in pro bono provides an opportunity to gain “real world” experience - to see firsthand the important role law plays in the life of an individual. Law is a privileged profession, one that assists in upholding and promoting justice, morality and the rule of law. This module sets a baseline for pro bono service at NUS, aimed at helping students develop professional skills, and exposing students to the non?pecuniary aspects of the profession that will sustain a long and satisfying career.","moduleCredit":0.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
