{"moduleCode":"BMF5351","title":"Household Finance","description":"This elective module in the MSc Finance programme will be structured around the theme of household financial decision making. Specifically, Household Finance studies (1) how households make financial decisions relating to the functions of consumption, payment, risk management, borrowing and investing; (2) how institutions provide goods and services to satisfy these financial functions of households; and (3) how interventions by firms, governments and other parties affect the provision of financial services. This functional definition shows that\nhousehold finance is clearly a substantial component of the financial sector. These different functions shows that the scope of household finance spans multi disciplines, embracing not just finance and economics but also industrial organization (eg. automatic enrolment in workplace savings plan), law (eg. regulations of retail financial transactions), psychology (eg. decisions affected\nby framing and cognitive biases), and sociology (eg. decisions shaped by social networks).","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"BMF5322\nBMF5332","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"BIZ1-0204","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":50}]}]}
