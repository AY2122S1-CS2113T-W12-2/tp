{"moduleCode":"MLE1111","title":"Foundation Materials Science and Engineering I","description":"This module is a pure materials science and materials engineering module, which focuses on foundation and core concepts that practicing materials engineer must know. A number of applications will be used to help emphasise the importance of this core knowledge. Major topics covered in depth include: Atomic structure and bonding; structures, crystal systems, crystalline, noncrystalline and semicrystalline materials; Imperfections in Solids covering point defects, line defects, surface defects and grain boundaries; Fundamental concepts into mechanical properties of materials, involving statics and mechanics of materials, beam structures and beam bending will be covered here.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"A Level Physics or H1 Physics or H2 Physics or [PC1221 and PC1222]","preclusion":"MLE1101","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
