{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"GEK1011","description":"This introductory overview of linguistics aims at equipping students with a solid foundation in the object, methods and goals of the science of spoken language, the prime tool of human communication. Through a principled analysis of patterns of sound, form and meaning at the levels of word, sentence and text, students will gain insight into what it means to say that language is a rule-governed system and an organic whole. The results of this exploration will be useful to those interested in the relationship between language and mind, society and culture.","title":"The Nature of Language","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"Exempted from NUS Qualifying English Test, or passed NUS Qualifying English Test, or exempted from further CELC Remedial English modules.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EL1101E","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"W10","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"W2","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":300,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"W5","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"W7","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"W9","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"W4","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"W6","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"W3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"W9","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS4-0116","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W2","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W7","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS4-0116","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W8","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT9","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":225,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W4","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W5","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W6","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS4-0116","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"fulfillRequirements":["EL3880","EL3255","EL3256","EL3880C","EL3880D","EL3204","EL3206","EL3207","EL3880F","EL3211","EL3254","EL3253","EL3208","EL2151","EL3258","EL2111","EL3216","EL3261","EL2101","EL3214","EL3210","EL2102","EL3205","EL3203","EL3230","EL3222","EL3252"]}
