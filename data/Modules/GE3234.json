Some attention will also be given to the sources of evidence used in reconstructing historical landscapes.  The second part examines the significance of studying past landscapes for contemporary purposes. This will involve a discussion of the question of heritage in general, and more specifically, the debate surrounding urban heritage conservation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
