{"moduleCode":"UQF2101A","title":"Quantitative Reasoning Foundation: Epidemics","description":"This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and indeed moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach. While the most important element of the class will be a hands-on quantitative exploration of the problem in question, students will conclude by considering the limits of quantitative analysis in the chosen case.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.
