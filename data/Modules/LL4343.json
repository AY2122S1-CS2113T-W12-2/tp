{"moduleCode":"LL4343","title":"International Regulation of the Global Commons","description":"The global commons comprises the high seas, the deep seabed, outer space, the airspace above the exclusive economic zone and the high seas, as well as Antarctica, an ice-covered continent, and the Arctic, an ice-covered ocean. Each of these areas are governed by international treaty regimes that were developed specifically for that area. This course will examine and compare the international regimes governing activities in the global commons. It will also examine the evolving law on the obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause harm to the environment of the global commons.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"LL4343V/LL5343V/LL6343V International Regulation of the Global Commons","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
