{"moduleCode":"YHU2319","title":"Acting I","description":"This practice-based course provides an introduction to modern acting. It is suitable for those with or without previous performance experience. The course is grounded by basic Stanislavski scene work, augmented by an introduction to Viewpoints. Students perform two modern scenes, an audition monologue, and an original short movement piece. Rehearsal is required outside class time. The course is highly collaborative and cultivates a supportive ensemble. Students take healthy emotional risks that foster personal growth. While the course is based in realistic acting, the tools introduced are applicable to many different kinds of performance and beyond theatre.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1730,"endTime":1930,"venue":"Y-BlackBox","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1730,"endTime":1930,"venue":"Y-BlackBox","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
