{"moduleCode":"EE4308","title":"Autonomous Robot Systems","description":"The module introduces the concepts behind making mobile ground robots and unmanned aerial vehicles autonomous. Basic methods underlying robot path planning, sensor fusion, obstacle avoidance and mapping in robotic systems will be taught. The most recent advances in these systems will also be discussed. \nStudents will use the Robot Operating System (ROS) to simulate and implement these methods to enhance their learning experience.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"EE3331C Feedback Control Systems or ME2142 Feedback Control Systems","preclusion":"EE4306 Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems, \nCS4278 Intelligent Robots: Algorithms and Systems","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1200,"endTime":1300,"venue":"E3-06-07","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":60},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E3-06-07","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":60}]}]}
