{"moduleCode":"CS3210","title":"Parallel Computing","description":"The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to the field of parallel computing with hands-on parallel programming experience on real parallel machines. The module is divided into four parts: parallel computation models and parallelism, parallel architectures, parallel algorithm design and programming, and new parallel computing models. Topics includes: theory of parallelism and models; shared-memory architectures; distributed-memory architectures; data parallel architectures; interconnection networks, topologies and basic of communication operations; principles of parallel algorithm design; performance\nand scalability of parallel programs, overview of new parallel computing models such as grid, cloud, GPGPU.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS2100 or CG2007 or CG2028 or EE2024 or EE2028","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Dec 1, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"5","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":22},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":22},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"7","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":22},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"6","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":22},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":22},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":22}]}]}
