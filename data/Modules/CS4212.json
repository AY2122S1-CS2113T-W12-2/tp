{"moduleCode":"CS4212","title":"Compiler Design","description":"The objective of this module is to introduce the principal ideas behind program compilation, and discusses various techniques for program parsing, program analysis, program optimisation, and run-time organisation required for program execution. Topics covered include regular expressions, context-free grammars, lexical analysis, syntax analysis; different algorithms for parsing codes, such as top-down parsing, bottom-up parsing; translation to abstract syntax using modern parser generator technology, intermediate representation, semantics analysis, type system, un-optimised code generation, code optimisation, data-flow analysis, instruction scheduling.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS2104 Programming Language","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 22, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1700,"venue":"LT15","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"LT15","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]}]}
