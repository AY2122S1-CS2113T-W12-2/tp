{"moduleCode":"MUA6178","title":"Graduate Capstone Project in Music Leadership","description":"The capstone project is an individualised, self-directed application of research thinking and skills, building upon the work done in the Research Practices in Music module. Students will conceive and independently develop a project that investigates their chosen topic, demonstrating skills such as experimentation, literature review and quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. The final output for each project will vary based on the nature of the research, but must include a public presentation (e.g., lecture-recital) and a defence. Each student will be supported by at least one supervising mentor from the YST faculty.","moduleCredit":6.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"MUA5163 Research Practices in Music; this module is restricted to students enrolled in the Master of Music Leadership degree programme.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
