{"moduleCode":"PP5521","title":"The Economic Analysis of Law","description":"Judges make public policy through their decisions in individual cases. This observation is especially true of jurisdictions that recognize opinions as authoritative sources of law. Are case outcomes best explained by the economic notion of social efficiency? How should legal institutions and rules be designed to maximize welfare? This course provides an introductory survey of the answers to these questions, covering the economic analysis of both private and public law. Topics to be addressed include property, torts, contracts, crime, administrative law, and statutory interpretation. Critiques of the neo-classical law and economics tradition will also be considered.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
