{"moduleCode":"SE3214","title":"Heritage and Heritagescapes in Southeast Asia","description":"This module provides critical knowledge of the historical, natural, political and socio-cultural ‘work’ underlying the making, management and marketing of heritage(scapes) in Southeast Asia. It begins by focusing on relevant concepts, before considering the contemporary material, symbolic and social uses and impacts of heritage(scapes) within the region. It offers a broad overview of how (spatial) practices, ideas, policies and technologies have been mobilised for multiple purposes, and discusses issues that emerge when planning for, and promoting, this heritage for diverse populations. Ultimately, heritage(scapes) here are also conceptualised as veritable lens to understand and further enhance Southeast Asian societies today.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":25},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS5-0205","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
