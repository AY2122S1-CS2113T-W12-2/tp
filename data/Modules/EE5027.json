{"moduleCode":"EE5027","title":"Statistical Pattern Recognition","description":"The main objectives of this graduate module are to equip\nstudents with the fundamentals of statistical pattern\nrecognition (SPR) algorithms and techniques. PR deals\nwith automated classification, identification, and/or\ncharacterisations of signals/data from various sources.\nBecause real world data is noisy and uncertain, we will\nfocus on SPR techniques, with particular emphasis on the\ntheoretical foundations of various techniques. Topics\ncovered include: fundamentals of parameter estimation\n(maximum likelihood, maximum-a-posteriori, posterior\npredictive), supervised learning, generative models, naive\nBayes, discriminative models, logistic regression, nonparametric\ntechniques, Bayesian decision theory.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"This course assumes students have taken an undergraduate probability/statistics course, an undergraduate programming course and have at least a basic linear algebra background, all of which should be covered in a typical electrical engineering or computer science undergraduate program.","preclusion":"EE5907","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1700,"endTime":2100,"venue":"EA-06-04","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
