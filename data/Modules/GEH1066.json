{"moduleCode":"GEH1066","title":"Art Movements and -isms","description":"An interdiscisplinary study of the arts, ideas and values in different societies and the extent to which these spread from one society to another. We will explore why and how the arts germinate, proliferate, evolve, hibernate, revive, and die. But, how far must art grow to be called a movement? Primary emphasis is on western art and its intersections with other societies, including\nwest influencing east and east influencing the west, particularly in the musical and visual arts. The movements and –isms students study will vary each time the course is taught.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
