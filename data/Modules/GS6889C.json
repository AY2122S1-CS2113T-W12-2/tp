{"moduleCode":"GS6889C","title":"Scientific Communication Primer","description":"This practice-based module will acquaint students with the basics of effective oral communication. The module will emphasize the need for clarity and simplicity when expressing central messages, and will prepare students to structure their thoughts and bring them to screen, or slide in a reasonable timeframe. Through practical exercises based on their own research (either ISEP lab rotations or pre-ISEP projects), students will learn how to articulate themselves professionally to a multidisciplinary audience.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Integrative Science and Engineering Program","faculty":"NUS Graduate School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1700,"venue":"CELS-01-08","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
