{"moduleCode":"YSS2230","title":"Ethnic Diversity in Japan","description":"This course challenges the widespread myth of Japan as a “homogeneous” society by exploring the conception and practice of diversity in Japan. We will closely examine how social difference and marginality have been produced and experienced over time, looking at the ethnic and minority status of the aboriginal Ainu, Okinawans, resident Chinese and Korean communities, and Burakumin (descendants of historical outcastes), as well as other groups whose non-normative practices or identities mark them as minority groups, including victims of nuclear radiation, LGBTQ populations, the disabled and mentally ill, migrant and irregular workers, and the homeless.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1121 Comparative Social Inquiry or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
