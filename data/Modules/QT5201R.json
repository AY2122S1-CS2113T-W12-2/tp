{"moduleCode":"QT5201R","title":"Density Functionals for Many-Particle Systems","description":"This course will cover density functional theory and its variants for many-particle\nsystems (electrons in atoms, molecules, solids; ultracold atoms in traps and optical\nlattices) from the perspective of theoretical and mathematical physics and will also\ndeal with applications and the intricacies of numerical implementations. A central\ncomponent of the module are the lectures given during the IMS Programme on\nDensity Functionals for Many-Particle Systems (2-27 September 2019).","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Center for Quantum Technologies","faculty":"NUS Graduate School","prerequisite":"This module is open to all students at CQT, and to those in Physics, Mathematics,\nand Chemistry. Students from other departments and faculties are welcome, but it is advisable that they discuss their background with the module co-ordinator before\nenroling.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
