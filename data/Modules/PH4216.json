{"moduleCode":"PH4216","title":"Topics in Environmental Philosophy","description":"Environmental issues are now in the forefront of global attention. Our current environmental problems may arguably be said to ultimately trace their roots to (implicit) metaphysical assumptions, to cultural or religious attitudes towards the natural world, to ethical perspectives that do not accord moral consideration to nonhumans. This module will involve a critical and thorough discussion of specific topics in environmental philosophy. These may include topics in both Eastern and Western environmental traditions. Examples of topics that may be discussed are: the ethical problem of future generations, intrinsic values in nature, varieties of eco-feminism, and ecology in Neo-Confucian thought.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80MCs, including 28 MCs in PH, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
