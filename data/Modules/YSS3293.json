{"moduleCode":"YSS3293","title":"Christianities in Cross-Cultural Perspective","description":"What does it mean to be “Saved” in different social and cultural contexts? This Anthropology module examines Christianities in different world regions, and queries their distinctive theologies and social histories. How have different forms of Christianity been embraced, rejected, and/or “syncretically” incorporated into local structures of religious belief and practice? How have Christian ideas of salvation articulated or disarticulated with different liberation movements (e.g. abolitionist, anti-colonial, nationalist)? We will examine some antagonistic and also some accommodating ways that Christian denominations interface with non-Christian traditions. Note: the module approaches these questions from ethnographically-grounded, social scientific perspectives, rather than from faith-based ones.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
