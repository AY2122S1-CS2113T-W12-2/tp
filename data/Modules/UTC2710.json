{"moduleCode":"UTC2710","title":"Energy and Environment: Singapore and ASEAN Perspectives","description":"Energy, environment, sustainability and climate change are\nmulti-disciplinary and inter-related elements.With the\nincrease in green consciousness and possible media hype,\nthe quest for single-point, easy, solutions arise. This module\ntakes a systems-thinking perspective to discover the\ncomplex technological interactions behind the\npolitical/socio-economic policies in energy/environment in\nSingapore and the ASEAN region. Explosive economic\ndevelopment regionally, where investment in infrastructure\nprovides rapid “Returns on Investment’, means that there is\ngreater competition for patient or impact capital for longerterm\nsustainable projects. Hence, this module shows that\nwhile technology is a necessary condition for economic\ndevelopment, it remains an insufficient condition.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","preclusion":"UTS2703 or UTC27%","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
