{"moduleCode":"UTC1702E","title":"Thinking in Systems: Energy Systems","description":"Are energy sources infinite? Do energy policies lead to a sustainable energy development? Would renewables solve our future energy needs, mitigate emissions and protect our environment? Students deal with such energy challenges by learning to understand ‘energy systems’ as a ‘complex\nwhole’. This module provides a platform for students to understand the complex behavior arising from interdependent interactions of different actors of energy systems with other economic, political, social, technological and environmental factors. To achieve this, it engages students to learn and apply systems thinking tools to such aforementioned challenges through relevant models, case studies and real-world energy policy/problem scenarios.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","preclusion":"GEM1914 or GEM1915% or GEM1918 or GEM1919 or GET1011 or UTC1411 or UTC1702% or UTC1701 or UTC1700","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1930,"endTime":2130,"venue":"RC4-SR3","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"RC4-SR1-2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"RC4-SR1-2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16}]}]}
