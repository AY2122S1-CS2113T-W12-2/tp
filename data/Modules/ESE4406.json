{"moduleCode":"ESE4406","title":"Energy Systems and Climate Change Mitigation","description":"All energy sources have some impact on our environment. Fossil fuels do substantially more harm than renewable energy sources by most measures. It is essential for environmental professionals to improve their awareness of energy, understand and minimise its impact on the environment. It is also important for them to understand the science and technology behind energy generation, distribution and use, based on which effective environmental control programs can be built to mitigate climate change. Overall, this module provides an insight into the relationship between integration of renewable energy systems and “decarbonisation”, and a broad vision for a sustainable energy future.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"CN4248","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"ENG-AUD","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}]}]}
