{"moduleCode":"GESS1030","title":"Public Health in Singapore: Challenges and Changes","description":"This course provides students with a broad survey of Singapore’s public health issues and challenges since the post-colonial period, situated within the socio-historical context of nation-building. Students will take a trip down memory lane and reflect on how and why different public health challenges have evolved through the ages, and think critically about how the nation can deal with both present and future health threats. Through an exploration of issues ranging from sanitation and hygiene, to pandemic preparedness and health promotion, this course provides an opportunity to investigate the centrality of public health management within Singapore’s national development project.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","preclusion":"GES1042","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":7},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":7},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":7},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":28},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":7}]}]}
