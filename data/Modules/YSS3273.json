{"moduleCode":"YSS3273","title":"Geospatial \u0026 Demographic Methods","description":"This course is designed to give training in spatial and demographic methods relevant to urban and social studies with three major foci: (a) essential theories regarding spatial and demographic structures and dynamics of cities (e.g., models of urban form, central place theory, rank-size rule); (b) methods of spatial visualization and analysis of urban social phenomena using (GIS) software (e.g., map projections, coordinate systems, spatial data manipulation \u0026 visualization, and geodatabase management); (c) techniques to calculate, interpret, and present basic spatial and demographic changes in cities using STATA software (e.g., immigration and ethnic diversity, racial segregation, concentrated poverty, and residential sprawl).","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"Y-CompLab","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
