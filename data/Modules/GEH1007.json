{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"GEC1038, GEM1049","description":"This module explores Asian cinema from its beginning to the introduction of talkies in the 1930s. The advent of cinema in Asia transformed entertainment across the continent and provided a novel means of popular expression. As a medium, cinema is closely tied to modernity and helps us understand how different societies and cultures in Asia responded to the modern transformation and how they appropriated it for their own ends. The module focuses on China, Japan, and India, three regions that developed a vibrant film culture and whose films have survived to the present day.","title":"Asian Cinema: The Silent Era","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEH1007","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS4-0115","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":17,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E5","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS8-0402","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":17,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS3-0309","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":17,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":17,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E6","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0208","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":17,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UTSRC-LT53","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":102,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0302","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":17,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-04T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
