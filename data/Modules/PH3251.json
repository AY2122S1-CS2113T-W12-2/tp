{"moduleCode":"PH3251","title":"The Nature of Truth","description":"This course investigates controversies surrounding the nature of truth, a notion which is of central interest but which generates widespread and fundamental disagreement. We will address questions like: Is truth an objective matter, independent of how we conceive it, or is it relative to cultures or worldviews? Can there be truths that are unknowable in principle? How should our understanding of truth be affected by fundamental and far-reaching paradoxes involving the concept? Does truth even have a nature at all? Discussing these questions will also shed light on other important philosophical notions, such as reality, objectivity, knowledge, justification, and representation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"GEM2006 Logic or GET1028 Logic","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
