{"moduleCode":"EL3251","title":"Language, Society and Identity","description":"This module explores the relationship between language and identity, focusing on how linguistic difference is not a reflection of one’s inner essence but a means of constructing who we are in social context. Based on current research in sociolinguistics, it will discuss why ideological and discursive processes of identity construction are central to our social life. It will also introduce conceptual tools for analysing identity work in everyday discourse, using them to explore several theoretical and real-world issues in which the question of identity figures prominently.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"EL2151 or EL2251","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
