{"moduleCode":"YHU4253","title":"The Global South Novel","description":"The Global South, emerging from the Cold War era terminology of the “Third World,” is increasingly seen as an alternative to postcolonial or diaspora studies as a framework for studying supranational networks of exchange and co-operation. Combining readings in literary theory with an exhilarating romp through a number of contemporary novels, this course asks how the Global South is defined, what this framework offers students of literature, and what the Global South novel as a genre would look like. We investigate the hypothesis that the Global South novel is one that self-consciously works to imagine transnational subaltern connections or solidarity.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2; or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
