{"moduleCode":"MA5253","title":"Riemann Surfaces","description":"This course will be an introduction to Riemann surfaces, focusing on topics such as topology of Riemann surfaces, divisors and line bundles, differential forms and Hodge theory, the Riemann-Roch theorem, period mappings, the Poincaré-Koebe uniformisation theorem. We will also discuss more advanced topics such as algebraic curves, hyperbolic geometry and discrete groups of automorphisms.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA4247 or departmental approval","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 22, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":27},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":27}]}]}
