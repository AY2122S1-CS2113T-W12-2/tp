{"moduleCode":"MA3227","title":"Numerical Analysis II","description":"This module is a continuation of MA2213 Numerical Analysis I. It introduces and\nanalyzes important numerical methods for solving linear and nonlinear systems,\ntwo-point boundary value problems, as well as Monte Carlo methods and their\napplications in such fields as quantitative finance and physics. The module aims at\ndeveloping students’ problem-solving skills in emerging applications of modern\nscientific computing, and is intended for mathematics and quantitative finance\nmajors and students from engineering, computer science and physical sciences.\nMajor topics: Iterative methods for systems of linear equations and their\nconvergence analysis, numerical solutions of systems of nonlinear equations,\nmethods for solving two-point boundary value problems, Monte Carlo methods\nand their applications.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"(MA2213 or DSA2102) and (MA1104 or MA2104 or MA1505 or MA1506 or MA1507 or MA1511 or MA2311) and (MA2216 or ST2131 or ST2334)","preclusion":"ME3291","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"S17-0406","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1000,"venue":"S17-0405","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"S17-0406","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
