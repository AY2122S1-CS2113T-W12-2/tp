{"moduleCode":"MA3219","title":"Computability Theory","description":"This is an introductory course on the formal theory of computable functions. In particular, we will describe the notion of computability and answer the question whether every function from N (the set of natural numbers) to N is computable. Major topics: Turing machines. Partial recursive functions. Recursive sets. Recursively enumerable sets. Unsolvable problems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA1100 or MA1100S or CS1231 or CS1231S","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
