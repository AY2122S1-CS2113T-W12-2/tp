{"moduleCode":"BL5699","title":"Capstone Project in Biotechnology","description":"This is an independent, project-based module that can be completed in most cases without experimental laboratory work.\n\nStudents will complete a Master’s-level project related to biotechnology. Rather than a one-size-fits-all project module, students will initiate, carry out, write up, and present their project in one of several possible frameworks, with learning outcomes and assessment criteria appropriate for a master’s level programme. Faculty will serve as student mentors. Frameworks for projects include the following:\n\n- Systematic review and meta-analysis.\n- Emerging technology review\n- Business development or new technology proposal\n- Computational analysis project\n- Computational methods project","moduleCredit":8.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
