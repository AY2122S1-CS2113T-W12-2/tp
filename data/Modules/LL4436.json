{"moduleCode":"LL4436","title":"Family Law and Practice","description":"Family Law covers a very broad field that involves familial relationships wider than just spousal relationships, children and money matters. It encompasses transnational conflict of laws, marital agreements, international conventions and enforcement issues. It also sees intersectionality with elder law, mental capacity, as well as probate and succession law. It is not possible to cover every aspect of family law in this elective. This course will cover family law and practice in Singapore, with a special emphasis on marriages, divorce and ancillary matters for civil marriages, and the workings of the Family Justice Courts.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"LL4403/LL5403/LL6403 Family Law;\nLL4436V/LL5436V/LL6436V Family Law and Practice","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
