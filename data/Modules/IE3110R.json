{"moduleCode":"IE3110R","title":"Simulation","description":"This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modeling techniques, random number generators, discrete-event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyze and develop simulation models of given problems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"IE2100 or DSC3215","preclusion":"DSC3221","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 25, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1500,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E1A-05-19","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":45},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1100,"endTime":1300,"venue":"E1A-05-19","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":45},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":90}]}]}
