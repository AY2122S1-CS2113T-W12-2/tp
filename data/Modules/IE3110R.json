{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"DSC3221","description":"This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modeling techniques, random number generators, discrete-event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyze and develop simulation models of given problems.","title":"Simulation","department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0.5,0.5,3,3],"prerequisite":"IE2100 or DSC3215","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"IE3110R","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1A-05-19","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":45,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1A-05-19","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":45,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":90,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-11-25T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["IE2100","DSC3215"]}}
