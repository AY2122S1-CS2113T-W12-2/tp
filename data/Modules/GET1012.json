{"moduleCode":"GET1012","title":"Thinking Science on Computer","description":"The aim of this module is to help students understand how nature works by exploring simple computer modelling and using simulation techniques. Examples from predator-prey systems, vehicular traffic, fire-fly flash synchronisation, ant colonies, earthquakes, DLA, disease spreading, and social-economic systems are used to illustrate the emergence of complexity in self-organising systems. The module will help students appreciate how computer modelling provides an algorithmic way of thinking about the science of complex systems and the complexity of their simulation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","preclusion":"GEM2503","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
