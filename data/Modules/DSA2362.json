{"moduleCode":"DSA2362","title":"Decision Trees for Machine Learning and Data Analysis","description":"Decision tree methods predict the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules from the data. In this module, participants will learn decision tree methods and how to use software to build predictive models and score variables in terms of their importance. They will use real data to compare the strengths and weaknesses of decision tree models with those obtained by linear and logistic regression and discriminant analysis. Participants will also learn how to handle data with missing values without requiring prior imputation. Possible applications include economic surveys, credit card data, vehicle crash tests data and precision medicine.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"DSA1361 or department approval","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
