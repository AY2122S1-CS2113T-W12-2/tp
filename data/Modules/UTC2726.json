What led to the collapse of past and present-day societies, and what can we learn from them? Did these societies foresee the impending calamities threatening their existence? If not, why not? If yes, why did they not act in time? How is Singapore vulnerable to existential threats plaguing the world today and how do we strengthen our resilience? In this module, students will explore these questions through the lens of existing theories, illuminated through the use of causal-loop diagramming and insights gained through computer simulation.","title":"Societal Collapse & Resilience","department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"NUS","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC2726","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["GEM1918","GEM1919","UTC1700","UTC1701","UTC1702"]}}
