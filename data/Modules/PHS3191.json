{"moduleCode":"PHS3191","title":"Laboratory Techniques in Pharmaceutical Science II","description":"This module extends from PHS2191 to introduce the theory and practical applications of further major tools and techniques used in the continuum of drug discovery and development. Factual knowledge in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic techniques, such as enzyme kinetics, CYP inhibition, drug-drug interaction assays; and in pharmaceutical biology, such as cell viability/toxicity testing, DNA extraction and purification, aseptic techniques/cell culture, will be integrated with laboratory practice.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Pharmacy","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PHS2191 Laboratory Techniques in Pharmaceutical Science I","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1600,"venue":"MD1-06-01A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":45}]}]}
