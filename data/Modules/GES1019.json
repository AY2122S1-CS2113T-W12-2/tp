It enables students to have an understanding and appreciation of the economic and social aspects and implications of how properties and infrastructure are developed and managed, given the constraints that Singapore faces.  It also encourages them to develop alternative views on how the built environment can help Singapore continue to prosper and remain relevant in the region.
