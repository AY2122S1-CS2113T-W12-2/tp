{"moduleCode":"YSS4247","title":"Global and Transnational Urbanism","description":"This module examines the multiple ways in which cities are built across national boundaries. Processes of urbanization have been long shaped by global flows of capital, people, and knowledge. These transnational currents raise important questions for how we understand urban development, past and present. This advanced seminar will give students the chance to carefully review a range of perspectives on the phenomenon of global and transnational urbanism. Topics will range from the effects of maritime trade and colonial expansion on the production of space, the rise of global logistics, the emergence of the idea of  “world cities,” and recent trends in itinerant urban expertise.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","preclusion":"YSS4239  Adv Seminar in Urban Studies: Transnational Urbanism","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
