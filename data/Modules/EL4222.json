{"moduleCode":"EL4222","title":"Stylistics and Drama","description":"This module highlights one way in which the disciplines within the Department (theatre, literary studies and linguistics) can be brought together in the enterprise to come to terms with dramatic discourse. The module will focus on the analysis of dramatic discourse, so that evidenced interpretations of dramatic passages may be provided. Students will be introduced to a number of frameworks, especially those used to deal with discourse such as speech-act theory, the co-operative principle, face and politeness, cognitive and critical discourse approaches. Key topics in stylistics such as foregrounding and reader response will also receive coverage.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EL or 28 MCs in TS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","preclusion":"TS4213","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 4, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS5-0309","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
