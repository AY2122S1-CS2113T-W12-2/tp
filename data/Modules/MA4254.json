{"moduleCode":"MA4254","title":"Discrete Optimization","description":"Discrete optimization deals with problems of maximizing or minimizing a function over a feasible region of discrete structure. These problems come from many fields like operations research, management science and computer science. The primary objective of this module is twofold: (a) to study key techniques to separate easy problems from difficult ones and (b) to use typical methods to deal with difficult problems. \n\nMajor topics: Integer programming: cutting plane techniques, branch and bound enumeration, partitioning algorithms, the fixed charge and plant location problems. Sequencing and job-shop scheduling. Vehicle routing problems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA2215 or MA3252 or DSC3214 or DSN3701","preclusion":"MA3235, ISE students.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Dec 1, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":60},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1900,"endTime":2200,"venue":"S17-0611","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]}]}
