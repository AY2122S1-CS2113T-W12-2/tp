{"moduleCode":"BMS5116A","title":"People Strategy","description":"Deploying human capital is very different from deploying financial capital. Dollars and Euros will go where you send them - and they never complain. People, on the other hand, are completely different. And in a digital era where great people are crucial to success, a right people strategy will be the key factor to conquer the digital force.\nGetting your people right is beyond HR. People are the key to understand how value can be created and, more importantly, appropriated in the era of Cloud, IoT and AI. \nThis course develops students’ ability to evaluate, design, and execute the people strategy using the CEO’s point of view.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
