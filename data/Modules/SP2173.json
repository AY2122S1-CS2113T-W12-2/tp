{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This is the first module of an interdisciplinary program covering nature at different scales from â€œAtoms to Moleculesâ€?, â€œThe Cellsâ€?, â€œThe Earthâ€? and â€œThe Universeâ€?. â€œAtoms to Moleculesâ€? strives to answer a simple question: â€œHow do atoms come together to produce the vibrant diversity observed in the physical, chemical and biological world?â€?\n\nTo this end we follow mansâ€™ quest to understand the atom, the development of â€˜quantum mechanicsâ€™ and how this leads to our understanding of molecules as collections of atoms. We will also visit the development of techniques that probe the microscopic domain and use some of them (spectroscopy, tunnelling microscopy) in hands-on experiments. We will conclude by studying novel, cutting edge topics such as fullerenes and graphene.\n\nExtensive use of computational tools (e.g. MATHEMATICA) will be made for simulations and surmounting mathematical barriers.","title":"Atoms to Molecules","department":"FoS Dean's Office","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,2,2,1,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SP2173","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[],"fulfillRequirements":["SP2174","SP3277"]}
