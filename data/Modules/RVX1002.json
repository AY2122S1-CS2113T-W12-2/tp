{"moduleCode":"RVX1002","title":"What do you mean? Meaning \u0026 Communication in Intercultural contexts","description":"This module examines meaning and culture. It draws attention to issues in translation and intercultural communication, and advocates the use of a framework that facilitates effective communication with cultural others at work or elsewhere. As cultural beings, we express meaning in a cultural context, but do we understand the implications? We assume that English words have the same meaning across cultures, but how valid is this assumption? We learn Standard English but does it embody the cultural meanings we want to express? This module raises awareness of our cultural selves and helps students develop meaningful connections with cultural others.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying English Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic Purposes modules.","preclusion":"UTW1001 and UTW2001 series modules","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"RVR-SRM01","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"RVR-SRM01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16}]}]}
