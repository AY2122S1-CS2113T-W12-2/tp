{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"MLE1001, MLE1001A","description":"This is the first of a two module set: Engineering Principle and Practice I and II (EPP I and EPP II) to introduce first year students to how materials engineers think and address societal problems. EPP I will use hands-on lab experiences with state-of-the-art applications of both soft materials (e.g. polymers whose applications span drug delivery to aircraft windows) and hard materials (e.g. silicon, whose applications span transistors to solar cells) integrated with targeted chemistry and physics lecture content to understand how these materials work. Instruction on experimental methods, and both oral and written scientific communication are key learning objectives.","title":"Materials Science & Engineering Principles & Practice 1","department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2,1.5,1.5,0,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MLE1001B","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E5-03-20","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":70,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":70,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1600","weeks":[2,4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E3A-05-03","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":35,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[2,4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E3A-05-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":35,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E5-03-20","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":70,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"]}]}
