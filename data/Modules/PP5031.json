The module will also provide a comparative perspective of how Singapore has differed from the rest of the South East Asian economies in terms of its development strategies, as well as discuss the contemporary challenges it faces in a post-Covid-19 world.","moduleCredit":1.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":830,"endTime":2000,"venue":"LKY_SR3-1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90}]}]}
