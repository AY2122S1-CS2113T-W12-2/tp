This seminar investigates the role that international law can play, along with its shortcomings, in suppressing and preventing terrorism. It examines the manner in which terrorism and counterterrorism laws and policies have affected the scope and application of diverse international legal regimes including UN collective security, inter-State use of force, the law of international responsibility, international human rights, international humanitarian law, and international criminal law.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
