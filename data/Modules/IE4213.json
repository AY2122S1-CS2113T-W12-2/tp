{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module teaches students data analytics and machine learning techniques for solving large scale engineering problems. The module covers statistics and machine learning concepts and algorithms such as linear regression, support vector machine, decision trees, feature engineering, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. How these algorithms are scaled up and incorporated in data engineering pipelines to tackle large scale problems will be covered. Students will be exposed to practical case studies of engineering problems with realistic datasets or streaming data, and perform data engineering operations using software tools.","title":"Learning from Data","department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,1,0,2,4],"prerequisite":"IE3101 or ST2334 or EE2012 or CE2407 or CE2407A or BN2102 or EE2012A or ST1131 or ST2131","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"IE4213","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"aliases":["EE4802"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT4","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT4","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT4","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-04T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["IE3101","ST2334","EE2012","CE2407","CE2407A","BN2102","EE2012A","ST1131","ST2131"]}}
