{"moduleCode":"YHU3347","title":"Media Arts for Just Futures","description":"In face of the cascading effects of climate change, this art practice course teaches students to use experimental media art to respond to the age of capitalism and extractivism. During the initial exploratory phase, group discussions and readings will be complemented by site-visits, archival/collections-based research, media archaeology exercises, and collaborative projects. Students will then enact theory in the studio by bringing drawing skills into 2D and 3D digital media platforms to hack dominant narratives. This will culminate in a body of creative work to be shared at the end of the semester in critique sessions.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
