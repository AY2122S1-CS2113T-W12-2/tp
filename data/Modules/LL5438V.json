{"moduleCode":"LL5438V","title":"Intellectual Property Arbitration","description":"This course introduces students to the exciting world of intellectual property arbitration. Traditionally thought of and taught as distinct areas of law, the overlap between IP rights and recourse to arbitration for the protection of those rights has grown significantly in recent years. This pioneering course is not currently offered in any other leading law school in the world. It is designed for students with little to\nno knowledge of IP law. It is also designed for students with an interest in arbitration, regardless of the level of their preexisting knowledge of arbitration.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"LL4438/LL5438/LL6438 Intellectual Property Arbitration","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Hybrid_D","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
