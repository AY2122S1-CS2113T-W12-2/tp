{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"EC3377","description":"In this module, we use economic theory and quantitative methods to understand why some countries grew rich while others did not. Since the operation of an economy cannot be devoid of its institutional context, special attention will be paid to the political economy of development.
