{"moduleCode":"ESE2102","title":"Principles \u0026 Practice in Environmental Monitoring","description":"Singapore is committed to become the World’s greenest city but how can economic development and environmental sustainability combine to create a truly liveable place? Engineers have a significant role to play in developing technical solutions that must be practical and economically feasible. In this module, students practice environmental engineering outside the classroom by teaming up as consultancy firms to undertake real-life projects: for example, monitoring water quality in the Singapore Botanic Gardens or mapping air pollution by drone sensing.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"ESE1102","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"02","startTime":1000,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EW2-03-14","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":50},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1000,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EW2-03-14","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":50},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]}]}
