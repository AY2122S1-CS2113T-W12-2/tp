{"moduleCode":"ESE5204B","title":"Physico-Chemical Treatment for Hazardous Chemicals","description":"This course introduces the advanced concepts of toxic and\nhazardous chemical management issues. Major topics are\nquantification and characterization, toxicity, impact on\nhuman health, disposal and management practices. Part B\nfocuses on state-of-the-art physico-chemical technologies to\ntreat, stabilize and safely dispose of hazardous chemicals.\nThis course will expose students to the environmental risks\nfaced by caused by toxic and hazardous chemicals\ngenerated through human activities and the selection of\nstate-of-art degradation and separation techniques and\ndisposal strategies, including case studies in industrial\nwastewater and e-wastes.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":4,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4-04-03","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E4-04-03","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":930,"endTime":1230,"venue":"E3-06-08","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E4-04-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
