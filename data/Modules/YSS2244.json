{"moduleCode":"YSS2244","title":"Markets, Morality and Politics","description":"This course studies the morality and politics of market-based distribution. It does so in three parts. First, it studies the historical justifications for and criticisms of markets. Second, it examines contemporary debates about the necessity and limits of markets. Finally, it applies the discussions from the first two parts to market distribution of specific goods.\n\nImportantly, our primary concern throughout this course will be normative: to understand the justifications for today’s political economic world.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","preclusion":"YHU2268 Money","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
