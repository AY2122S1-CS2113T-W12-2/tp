{"moduleCode":"PHS2115","title":"Basic Principles of Drug Design and Development","description":"This module will demonstrate the application of chemical and pharmacological sciences in the processes of drug discovery beginning from lead identification phase to pre-clinical study phase. The main learning will focus on how molecules are modified into potential drug candidates through achieving suitable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles. Approaches in pharmacophore identification and principles in lead optimisation will be introduced. Chemical diversity in drugs will be illustrated through a selection of commercially available drugs. Structure-activity relationship will be elucidated using drugs of different pharmacological actions. The approaches to how drug disposition (ADMET) is optimised in the pre-clinical phase will be highlighted.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Pharmacy","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PHS1110 Foundation for Medicinal and Synthetic Chemistry","preclusion":"PR2115A Medicinal Chemistry for Drug Design and PR2115 Medicinal Chemistry for Drug Design","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 27, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"S4-02LAB","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"S16-0307","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":60}]}]}
