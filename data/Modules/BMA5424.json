{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Interest in entrepreneurship within established organisations has intensified due to various events taking place on business and social levels. On the social front, there is a rising interest among employees to create something meaningful on their own. Increasingly, employees have a strong need for individual autonomy and expression in their workplace. In the absence of such freedom, talented employees may leave out of frustration to search for an institution that can provide the meaning and the environment to achieve their self-actualization. Corporate entrepreneurship is one method of stimulating and capitalizing on employees’ need to think of new ideas and do things better for their organisation. On a business level, an organization needs self-renewal, which involves transformation through redefinition of its business concepts, reorganization of its business relationships and reengineering of its business processes. Creating a new venture from scratch is challenging, but developing it within an existing organization is a totally different ball game. This module focuses on corporate entrepreneurship with four key elements: new business venturing, innovativeness, selfrenewal and proactiveness. It has two primary objectives. First, the module aims to enable the students to apply corporate entrepreneurship-related concepts in practice. Second, it seeks to broaden the students’ education by helping them to appreciate the application of corporate entrepreneurship knowledge to companies. The students will also have the opportunity to meet corporate entrepreneurs to understand their challenges and strategic approaches in creating and capturing value for their organizations.","title":"Corporate Entrepreneurship and Business Model\nEvaluation","department":"BIZ Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"BMA5424","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"P1A","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1630","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Hybrid_C","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"P1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1830","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"venue":"BIZ1-0202","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["Unknown","B"]}]}
