There is a mapping between metaphors and the issues they are used to represent.  Students will read research papers written on Chinese metaphors and their usage in everyday language.  They will explore the different metaphors used in different writings such as sports reports, political speeches, business correspondences, etc. to understand why certain metaphors tend to be important in certain writings.  In understanding the usefulness and effectiveness of metaphors, students will understand the cognitive implications behind these metaphors.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in CH or CL, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
