{"moduleCode":"ESE4404","title":"Bioenergy","description":"Sustainability is the key to economic growth in the twenty-first century. With increasing global demand for energy, growing energy insecurity, and adverse impact of fossil fuel consumption on climate change, it is necessary to focus efforts toward bioenergy production from renewable, low-cost and locally available feedstock such as biomass and biowastes. This course introduces the various theories and technologies for production of bioenergy from various feedstocks. Topics include anaerobic technology for production of methane, bioethanol, methanol, hydrogen and biodiesel from biowastes and biomass, and microbial fuel cell for direct electricity production. Other processes such as pyrolysis of biomass shall also be introduced. Students will gain a comprehensive knowledge on the various options and challenges facing the production of bioenergy.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Year 3 standing or equivalent with background in fluid mechanics","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Dec 1, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1700,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT7","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":70},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"LT7","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":70}]}]}
