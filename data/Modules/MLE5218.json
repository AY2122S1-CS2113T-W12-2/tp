{"moduleCode":"MLE5218","title":"Materials Discovery with AI","description":"The module focuses on application of machine learning as a useful tool for discovery of new functional materials. It emphasises using machine learning for drug discovery as one of the most developed application area to date.  we will learn how to choose chemicals, as well as describe and select descriptions.  The module demonstrates which molecular features are responsible for particular molecular activities. Application areas includes not only drug discovery but also discovery of new functional materials with physical and chemical characteristics that are relevant for catalysis, sensors, membranes, and energy related materials.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"MLE5217","corequisite":"N.A.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
