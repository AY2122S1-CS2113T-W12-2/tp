{"moduleCode":"GEM3902","title":"Independent Study","description":"The Independent Study Module (ISM) provides an opportunity for senior undergraduates who are staying at the College of Alice \u0026 Peter Tan (CAPT) to do \nindependent critical reading or research work. Unlike a UROP, where the student contributes to an existing research project, an ISM is an individual study \nprogramme conceptualized by the student. ISMs undertaken at CAPT must be inter-disciplinary, multidisciplinary, or trans-disciplinary in topic and/or approach. \nStudent and supervisor need to submit for approval an ISM contract that gives a clear account of the topic, programme of study, evaluation, and other pertinent \ndetails. The ISM is a graded module.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","preclusion":"UTC3400","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
