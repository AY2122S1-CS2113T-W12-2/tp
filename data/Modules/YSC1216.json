{"moduleCode":"YSC1216","title":"Calculus","description":"Calculus unites the study of instantaneous rates of change, area and optimisation, via the mathematical concepts of limit and infinity. This module provides a conceptual framework for Calculus. We eschew full mathematical rigour, but emphasise real world phenomena more than the rote formal calculations that make up a typical high school Calculus class.\n\nThis module is suitable not only for those who have never learned Calculus before, but also for those who have completed a high school Calculus course. Students completing the module will be prepared for discipline-specific classes in the Sciences and Social Sciences which make use of Calculus.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","preclusion":"MA1102R Calculus or MA1505 Mathematics I or MA1511 Engineering Calculus or MA1521 Calculus for Computing","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 30, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":180,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1030,"endTime":1230,"venue":"Y-CR17","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1030,"endTime":1230,"venue":"Y-CR17","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25}]}]}
