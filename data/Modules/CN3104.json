{"moduleCode":"CN3104","title":"Computer-Aided Chemical Process Simulation","description":"This module teaches students how to use MATLAB and HYSYS to simulate chemical processes. First principle models will be developed in MATLAB to simulate operation of non-ideal chemical reactors. Built-in models in HYSYS will be used to simulate other unit operations and integrated processes. Students will learn how to link different types of models to produce a more complex, comprehensive model. They will also learn how to use the developed models to optimize the associated processes in silico.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"MA1512 Differential Equations for Engineering\nMA1513 Linear Algebra with Differential Equations\nCN2103 Mass and Energy Balance\nCN2105 Reaction Engineering","preclusion":"CN3421A Process Modeling and Numerical Simulation","corequisite":"CN3103 Mass Transfer and Separation Processes","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
