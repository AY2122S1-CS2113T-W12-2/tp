{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"CN3421A Process Modeling and Numerical Simulation","description":"This module teaches students how to use MATLAB and HYSYS to simulate chemical processes. First principle models will be developed in MATLAB to simulate operation of non-ideal chemical reactors. Built-in models in HYSYS will be used to simulate other unit operations and integrated processes. Students will learn how to link different types of models to produce a more complex, comprehensive model. They will also learn how to use the developed models to optimize the associated processes in silico.","title":"Computer-Aided Chemical Process Simulation","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2,2,0,2,4],"prerequisite":"MA1512 Differential Equations for Engineering\nMA1513 Linear Algebra with Differential Equations\nCN2103 Mass and Energy Balance\nCN2105 Reaction Engineering","corequisite":"CN3103 Mass Transfer and Separation Processes","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CN3104","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["MA1512","MA1513","CN2103","CN2105"]}}
