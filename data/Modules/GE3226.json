{"moduleCode":"GE3226","title":"Tourism Development","description":"This module evaluates the intersections and diversions between development and leisure/tourism.  Using critical development lenses, the module will first critique “big D”  Development’s (specific intentional interventions to achieve improvement or progress) globalized approaches in tourism development and then “respond” to these critiques by considering more localized political, economic, and cultural connections in tourism strategies.  While localized  “development” projects often suggest more equitable growth, input from local stakeholders, and incorporation of livelihood strategies and grounded knowledge, and more “sustainable” models with a long-term sensibility, the module will take a critical position toward these ideas as well.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 26, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT12","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}]}]}
