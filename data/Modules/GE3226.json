{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module evaluates the intersections and diversions between development and leisure/tourism.  Using critical development lenses, the module will first critique â€œbig Dâ€?  Developmentâ€™s (specific intentional interventions to achieve improvement or progress) globalized approaches in tourism development and then â€œrespondâ€? to these critiques by considering more localized political, economic, and cultural connections in tourism strategies.  While localized  â€œdevelopmentâ€? projects often suggest more equitable growth, input from local stakeholders, and incorporation of livelihood strategies and grounded knowledge, and more â€œsustainableâ€? models with a long-term sensibility, the module will take a critical position toward these ideas as well.","title":"Tourism Development","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GE3226","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT12","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-04-26T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
