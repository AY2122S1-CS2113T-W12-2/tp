{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The module serves the larger goals of the USP academic journey by treating students to a four-fold stroll through big ideas on human inquiry and the nature of the world, where four different instructors with different intellectual backgrounds will introduce you to, and help you reflect upon different modes of inquiry that constitute the modern knowledge enterprise. By introducing you to these ideas, we seek to leverage upon your existing curiosity in subjects that go beyond your specializations, and also to encourage you to seek out new things to learn, and to reflect upon what you learn.","title":"University Scholars Seminar","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","workload":[0,2,0,0,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"USS2105","attributes":{"su":true,"year":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
