{"moduleCode":"PL4203","title":"Cognition","description":"This module introduces the student to the fundamental issues of cognitive science. Specifically, the main concern is how we might model cognition. The topics include the modes of representation, issues relating to the processing of information, and the nature of cognitive architectures. Both classical models of cognition and connectionist models will be considered. There will be several sessions of computer simulation of basic connectionist models. This course is mounted for students interested in how we might study how the mind works.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Psychology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs of which student must have passed PL1101E, PL2131, PL2132 and 4 out of the 5 core modules (PL3232/PL3102 - PL3236/PL3106), in which one must be PL3233/PL3103, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 30, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"AS4-0119","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":60}]}]}
