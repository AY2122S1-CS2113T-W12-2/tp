{"moduleCode":"PS3312","title":"World Orders","description":"This module examines patterns of international political order in different traditions of thought. The content of the module focuses on Chinese, Islamic, and European conceptions of international political order in ancient, medieval, and modern context. Particular attention will be given to the assumptions that ground different traditions of thought—units of analysis, conditions of membership, role of morality, and so forth—and the purposes for which specific arrangements of international political order are justified. The module is historical and philosophical in orientation, with theoretical questions being at the centre of inquiry.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
