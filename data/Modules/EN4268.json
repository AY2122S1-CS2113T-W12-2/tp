{"moduleCode":"EN4268","title":"World Literature: Theories, Methods, Texts","description":"This course introduces some key texts of the major theorists (Casanova, Damrosch, Moretti, Apter, etc.) of World Literature today. This is to enable students to better approach World Literature in the 21st century. In that respect, we will also touch on some methodologies that are rather unique to World Literature research. We will then bring these theoretical and methodological aspects, along with other thematic issues pertinent to World Literature (particularly the question of citizenship), to bear in our readings of writers including Mohsin Hamid, Ocean Vuong, and Han Kang.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":42}]}]}
