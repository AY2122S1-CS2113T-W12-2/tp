{"moduleCode":"EE4302","title":"Advanced Control Systems","description":"This module provides the foundation for a more advanced level control systems course. Topics include system description, controllability, observability, selection of pole locations for good design, observer design, full-order and reduced-order observers, combined control law and observer. It is also a first course in nonlinear systems and control. Topics include non-linearities in control systems, use of root-locus in analysis of non-linear systems, describing function and its use in analysis and design of control systems, non-linear ordinary differential equations, singular points, and phase-plane analysis.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"EE3331C","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 22, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"01","startTime":2000,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":60}]},{"semester":3,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1730,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1730,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"01","startTime":2000,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":50},{"classNo":"01","startTime":2000,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":50}]}]}
