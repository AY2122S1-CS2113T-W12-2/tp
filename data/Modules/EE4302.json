{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module provides the foundation for a more advanced level control systems course. Topics include system description, controllability, observability, selection of pole locations for good design, observer design, full-order and reduced-order observers, combined control law and observer. It is also a first course in nonlinear systems and control. Topics include non-linearities in control systems, use of root-locus in analysis of non-linear systems, describing function and its use in analysis and design of control systems, non-linear ordinary differential equations, singular points, and phase-plane analysis.","title":"Advanced Control Systems","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2,1,0.5,2.5,4],"prerequisite":"EE3331C","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EE4302","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"2000","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-11-22T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":3,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1730","endTime":"2000","weeks":{"start":"2022-05-12","end":"2022-06-16"},"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1730","endTime":"2000","weeks":{"start":"2022-05-11","end":"2022-06-15"},"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"2000","endTime":"2100","weeks":{"start":"2022-05-12","end":"2022-06-16"},"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":50,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"2000","endTime":"2100","weeks":{"start":"2022-05-11","end":"2022-06-15"},"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":50,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":"EE3331C","fulfillRequirements":["EE5101","ME5401"]}
