{"moduleCode":"EG2202","title":"From Design Thinking to Engineering Design","description":"This module begins with an introduction to the engineering design process in the context of design thinking, followed by its application into the conceptual solutions that the students have formulated in the prerequisite module. It bridges the design thinking process taught in the prerequisite module into the engineering design process, equipping the students with understanding and knowledge of translating conceptual solutions from users’ needs to realizable solutions through engineering design. Students will be taught in a studio and a workshop setting, and are\nexpected to actively practice what they have learnt and to present their work professionally.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"EG2201B (Design Thinking in Grand Engineering\nChallenges – Part 2)","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
