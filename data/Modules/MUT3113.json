{"moduleCode":"MUT3113","title":"Orchestration","description":"The terms orchestration and instrumentation go hand-in-hand. While instrumentation refers to the study of individual instruments, orchestration deals with the technique and process of writing for a group of instruments. This module will introduce students to the characteristics and abilities of the instruments in the symphonic orchestra and how they work together through in-class listening and writing assignments, orchestration projects, and performance. The module will also address many of the problems faced by composers, conductors, teachers, and performers. The technique of orchestration is an important part in every musician’s education.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"MUT 2203 Texture and Timbre","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1230,"endTime":1430,"venue":"YSTCM-SR7","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15}]}]}
