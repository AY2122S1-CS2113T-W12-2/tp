{"moduleCode":"IT3011","title":"Introduction to Machine Learning and Applications","description":"This module provides students with a broad understanding\nof the concepts, limitations, and applications of machine\nlearning. Students will be exposed to the fundamental\nconcepts of machine learning, including supervised\nlearning (regression and classification), clustering, and\nmethods such as SVM, neural networks, decision trees,\nand ensemble methods. Pitfalls and limitations such as\noverfitting, data leakage, bias, and ethical issues will be\ncovered. This module also emphasizes on the\napplications of machine learning to problems in different\ndomains (such as medicine, finance, engineering, science,\nbusiness, social science) and is suitable for noncomputing students.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"(CS1010 or its equivalent) and (MA1101R or MA1311 or MA1508E or MA1513) and \n(MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1507 or (MA1511 and MA1512) or MA1521) and \n(EE2012/A or MA2216 or ST2131 or ST2334)","preclusion":"BT4240, CS3244, DMX1401AI or its equivalents","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
