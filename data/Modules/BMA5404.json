{"moduleCode":"BMA5404","title":"Entrepreneurship \u0026 Innovation","description":"In a competitive environment, entrepreneurship is an essential and indispensable element in the success of every business organization - whether small or large, new or long-established. This course focuses on entrepreneurship, the processes involved in creating and exploiting new, innovative resource combinations and opportunities. The emphasis of innovation is made explicit in the course title.\n\nThis course focuses on two primary objectives. First to understand how one can enhance and increase innovativeness in any context. Innovation means that a new product, a new service or a new process is developed and pushed into the market. The range, scope, and complexity of the\nissues related to the creating and implementing something new is discussed. At the end of the course, the students will have learnt how to innovate.\n\nThe second objective of this course is to provide students with an opportunity for “hands-on” knowledge on starting an entrepreneurial firm. This objective will be accomplished by developing new ideas and asking the question on how one can implement them in the market and by doing\nhands-on interviews with entrepreneurs who have gone through the experience of founding a new venture.\n\nThe course utilizes class discussions of weekly assignments, brief lectures and case discussion. The course is based on an evidence-based management perspective in which there is careful discussion of what is known, what is conjecture, what is (useful) gut feeling and where does new knowledge come from and how it can be used. Discussion of assigned readings and cases and the completion of a field project are integral to meeting the course objectives.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"P1A","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Hybrid_C","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66},{"classNo":"P1A","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Hybrid_C","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66},{"classNo":"P1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"BIZ1-0302","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66},{"classNo":"P1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"BIZ1-0302","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66}]}]}
