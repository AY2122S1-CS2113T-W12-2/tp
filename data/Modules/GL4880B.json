{"moduleCode":"GL4880B","title":"Globalisation and the Imagination of Work","description":"What role does work play in our lives? What meaning and value do we make of it? Can we imagine a world without it? Using an inquiry-based approach, students will employ visual methods to document and analyse contemporary practices of and discourses surrounding “work.” The seminar revolves around a fieldwork project, which will result in a visual essay (photo or short video). Prior technical knowledge is not necessary, as skill workshops are incorporated throughout the semester. The goal of the seminar is to adopt a critical stance towards “work,” in order to better understand contemporary globalization as a cultural phenomenon.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GL/GL recognized non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
