{"moduleCode":"SN4276","title":"Epic Traditions in South- and SE-Asia","description":"The two Indian epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, - are mainly known through their classical representatives in Sanskrit language. They also exist, however, in many regional vernacular forms, some being “classics” in their own right (e.g. Kamban’s Iramavataram in Tamil, 11th c; Tulsidas’ Ramcaritmanas in Hindi, 16th c). Folkloristic renderings are available, too, besides Jain-, Buddhist-, and even Muslim-versions. The two texts have had a great impact on Southeast Asia, as is evident from literary traditions, performing arts and sculpture and painting. This module introduces the different epic traditions in India and looks into their spread to Southeast Asia.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SN, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
