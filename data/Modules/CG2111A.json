{"moduleCode":"CG2111A","title":"Engineering Principles and Practice II","description":"This module will be for the students who have completed EPP I and the project scope extends to handle challenges in large-scale systems. Similar to EPP I, students will first learn the fundamental principles on certain advanced concepts and then design and programme a real-world system. The module involves designing a complex computer engineering system that facilitates information processing, real-world interfacing, and understanding the effects of certain useful metrics such as, scaling, safety, security, sustainability, societal impact, fault-tolerant design, etc.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computing and Engineering Programme","faculty":"Multi Disciplinary Programme","prerequisite":"CS1010 or its equivalent","preclusion":"CG1112","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"04","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50},{"classNo":"02","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50},{"classNo":"03","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50},{"classNo":"04","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50},{"classNo":"02","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50},{"classNo":"03","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50}]}]}
