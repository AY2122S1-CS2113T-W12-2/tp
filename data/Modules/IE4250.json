{"moduleCode":"IE4250","title":"System Dynamics Modelling","description":"This module introduces to students the system dynamics modelling method, based on the foundations of systems thinking. System dynamics is a powerful methodology to support the inquiry of complex large-scale dynamic sociotechnical systems through computer simulation models. Central topics include feedback mechanisms, nonlinear\nrelationship, time delay models, causal loop diagramming stock-flow models, decision behaviour modelling, testing and validation of models. Instruction is supplemented with\ncase studies from supply chains, population and environmental modelling. Group projects are used facilitate hands-on model building and learning in and outside the classroom.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"IE2111","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
