{"moduleCode":"GEH1079","title":"Whatever it takes? Making War on Civilians","description":"This course seeks to analyse why killing ‘unarmed civilians’ has been so commonplace in war, across time and space. Why were defenceless unarmed people killed by armed forces? The word now used to define this theme is ‘non-combatant.’ But neither word nor concept is primordial, or was universal. The notion that some types of people should not be targets for military operations did not spring from our consciousness, or from any abstract sense of ethics or morality. It evolved historically, and not in any straight line. This course will ask the direct questions: how, why and to what ends?","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GEC1031","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15}]}]}
