{"moduleCode":"UTS2712","title":"Leadership At the Fringe","description":"We often experience leadership as someone leading from the top or as someone giving directions. In this module, we will learn about the leadership built upon active listening, good observation and meaningful participation - in particular with the less visible or marginalized communities in Singapore.\nThis is an inter-disciplinary experiential learning module where community engagement is a strong focus. Readings are designed to give us the framework for meaningful interaction when meeting niche experts and practitioners in class and on field trips, motivating deep reflection and an authentic understanding of leadership.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","preclusion":"UTS27% or UTC2725 or UTC2400","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
