{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"GET1039","description":"This course explores the arts through three different, but overlapping, questions: What is art? (including the polemics associated with this question), When is art? (i.e. creations that are interpreted as art, or not art, at different times), and Where is art?\n(i.e. why something is perceived as art when it is in one setting, but is generally otherwise unnoticed). Visits to Singapore locations for case studies are required. Students will study and apply several disparate theories, and will also write their own.","title":"What, When and Where is Art?","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","workload":[2,0,0,4,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEX1021","attributes":{"mpes2":true,"su":true,"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[]}
