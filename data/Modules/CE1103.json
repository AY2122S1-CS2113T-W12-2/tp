{"moduleCode":"CE1103","title":"Principles of Structural and Geotechnical Engineering","description":"This module aims to stoke the curiosity and passion of engineering students to the wonders of Civil Engineering. From iconic landmark structures such as horizontal longspan bridges and vertical skyscrapers, to massive underground MRT interchanges and complex intertwining subway tunnels, these structures must withstand both the forces of nature and those that mankind has intended for them.  This module introduces the engineering fundamentals behind the design and construction of such man-made marvels. Through learning the basic concepts of structural and geotechnical engineering, students will gain an appreciation of the key principles governing the equilibrium and stability of these complex structures.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"EG1109%/CE1109%/TCE1109 Statics And Mechanics Of Materials \nCE1101/CE1101A Civil Engineering Principles and Practice \nCE2112/TCE2112 Soil Mechanics","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"32","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"EW1-1M-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":15},{"classNo":"21","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"EW1-1M-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":15},{"classNo":"22","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"EW1-1M-03","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":15},{"classNo":"12","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"EW1-1M-03","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":15},{"classNo":"11","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"EW1-1M-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":15},{"classNo":"42","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"EW1-1M-03","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":15},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1500,"endTime":1600,"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1200,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1300,"endTime":1400,"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1600,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"31","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"EW1-1M-02","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":15},{"classNo":"41","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"EW1-1M-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":15}]}]}
