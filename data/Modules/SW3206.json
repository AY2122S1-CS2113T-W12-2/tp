{"moduleCode":"SW3206","title":"Gender Issues in Social Work Practice","description":"This module uses a life course approach to studying gender issues and their implications for social work practice. Three broad phases of the life course are examined: childhood and adolescence, mid-life, and old age. For each phase, the major issues affecting women that have implications for micro-level and macro-level social work practice will be examined. As there are some issues (e.g. role stereotypes) that recur over different phases of life, they will be examined over the life course.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Social Work","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
