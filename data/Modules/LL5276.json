{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Advanced Contract Law invites students to examine some interesting and controversial topics from this foundational subject. Some topics will build on what students already know in their first-year/basic contract law course (e.g. how does contract law deal with change of circumstances?), some will cover new ground (e.g. the role of good faith in contract law). You will be able to write a paper on a topic of particular interest to you. The course also complements the module Advanced Tort Law and Philosophical Foundations of Contract Law.","title":"Advanced Contract Law","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.  \nStudents must have completed the basic common law Contract Law course in an LLB programme","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LL5276","attributes":{"ssgf":true},"aliases":["LL6276","LL4276","LLJ5276"],"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3],"venue":"E-Learn_D","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3],"venue":"E-Learn_D","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1430","endTime":"1730","weeks":[1,2,3],"venue":"E-Learn_D","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
