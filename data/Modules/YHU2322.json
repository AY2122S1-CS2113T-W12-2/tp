{"moduleCode":"YHU2322","title":"Comics and Graphic Novels","description":"This course serves as an introduction to the literary art of comics and graphic novels. We will develop an appreciation of how this artform employs a unique visual grammar to create miniature imaginary worlds on paper that allow us to reimagine the world around us. We will study how this grammar developed historically and how it differs across cultures. Topics addressed include: 1) the development of the newspaper comic strip in the pre-war US; 2) the post-war global rise to popularity of action-adventure comics, particularly in Europe, the US, and Japan; and 3) the independent graphic novel movement of today.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2 or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1030,"endTime":1200,"venue":"Y-PgRm1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1030,"endTime":1200,"venue":"Y-PgRm1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
