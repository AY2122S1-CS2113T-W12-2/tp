{"moduleCode":"YSS3223","title":"Asian Medicine, the Body and Globalization","description":"In highly problematic ways Asian Medical Systems are colonial, Orientalist\nconstructs that have been heavily influenced by nationalism and the\nmodernity of religion. It is common to speak of Ayurveda (“Indian”\nmedicine), Unani (Greek/Arabic/”Islamic” medicine), Traditional Chinese\nMedicine and Tibetan Buddhist Medicine as though these are timeless, authentic, self?contained traditions. Drawing on a range of contemporary\ntheoretical insights in anthropology and history this course examines the way\nin which forms of “medical” knowledge and embodied practice in Asia are\nshaped by the cultural dynamics of pre?colonial, colonial and post?colonial\nglobalization.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","corequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
