{"moduleCode":"ST5214","title":"Advanced Probability Theory","description":"Probability measures and their distribution functions. Random variable: properties of mathematical expectation, independence, conditional probability and expectation. Convergence concepts: various modes of convergence of sequence of random variables; almost sure convergence, Borel-Cantelli Lemma, uniform integrability, convergence of moments. Weak and strong law of large numbers. Convergence in distribution, characteristic function: general properties, convolution, uniqueness and inversion, Lindeberg conditions and central limit theorem. This module is targeted at students who are interested in Statistics and are able to meet the pre-requisites.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"ST2131 or Departmental approval (compulsory to MSc by Research and AMP students)","preclusion":"MA5259","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 26, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
