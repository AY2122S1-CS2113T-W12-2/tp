{"moduleCode":"SPH2005","title":"Health, Society and the Social Determinants","description":"What are the social and economic determinants of health? How do meanings of ‘health’ differ across populations and communities? This module adopts a multi-disciplinary approach in examining the different understandings of ‘health’ in society, via thinking critically about real-world health issues and their management. Drawing from disciplines such as medical anthropology, urban sociology and human\ngeography, students will investigate how ‘health’ implicates – and is implicated by – the lives of individuals and societies. This module explores contemporary technological, ethical, political and cultural debates in health, healing and well-being.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","preclusion":"SPH2107","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"MD1-08-03E","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}]}]}
