Most legal problems presented to lawyers now include an element of electronic evidence. It is incumbent on judges, lawyers and legal academics to be familiar with the topic in the service of justice. Electronic evidence is ubiquitous.\nUsing an array of mobile technologies, people communicate regularly through social networking sites, e-mail and other virtual methods managed by organisations that are transnational. No area of human activity is free from the networked world â€“ this also means no area of law is free from the effects of electronic evidence.","title":"Electronic Evidence","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.\nLC3001A Evidence (A)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LL5440","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"LC3001A"}
