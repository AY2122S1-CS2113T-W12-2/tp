Divided into three sections, the seminar will familiarize students with: 1) the history of democratic thought and its critics (ancient, modern, and contemporary), 2) state-of-the-art democratic theory (aggregative and deliberative models of democracy, public reason, the epistemic turn), and 3) current debates on the challenges posed by social and technological transformations (post-truth, the role of social media, free-speech legislation).","title":"Democracy and Truth","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS2243","semesterData":[]}
