{"moduleCode":"YSS2243","title":"Democracy and Truth","description":"This module will explore the tense relation between democracy and truth, from the trial and death of Socrates in Classical Athens to discussions on the role of Facebook. Divided into three sections, the seminar will familiarize students with: 1) the history of democratic thought and its critics (ancient, modern, and contemporary), 2) state-of-the-art democratic theory (aggregative and deliberative models of democracy, public reason, the epistemic turn), and 3) current debates on the challenges posed by social and technological transformations (post-truth, the role of social media, free-speech legislation).","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
