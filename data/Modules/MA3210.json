{"moduleCode":"MA3210","title":"Mathematical Analysis II","description":"This is a continuation of MA2108 Mathematical Analysis I. The objective of this module is to develop rigorously all the basic results in one- and multi-variable calculus. The emphasis is on logical rigour. Major topics: total and partial derivatives, Jacobian matrix, differentiable functions, chain rule, mean value theorem, l’Hopital’s rule, Taylor’s theorem, convergence of derivatives; Riemann and Darboux integrals, Fubini’s theorem, convergence of integrals, improper integral of functions, fundamental theorem of calculus, integration by parts, differentiation under integral sign, change of variable formula.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA2108 or MA2108S","preclusion":"MA3110S, MA3110","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 27, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":70},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":70},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":70}]}]}
