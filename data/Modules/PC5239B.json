{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module will present a unified look at the basic\nbranches of physics (classical mechanics, quantum\nmechanics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics and\nstatistical physics) from the perspective of variational\nprinciples, which offer compact statements of the\nfundamental laws and are also an important tool for\ndesigning models and finding approximate solutions.","title":"Variational Principles","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[4,1,0,3,2],"prerequisite":"This module is open to all students at the Dept of Physics\nand CQT. Students from other departments and faculties\nare welcome, but it is advisable that they discuss their\nbackground with the lecturer before registering. Enrolled\nstudents are expected to have the usual background of a\nphysics graduate student.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC5239B","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CQT/SR0315","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CQT/SR0315","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CQT/SR0315","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
