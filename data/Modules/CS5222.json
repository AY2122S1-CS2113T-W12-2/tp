{"moduleCode":"CS5222","title":"Advanced Computer Architecture","description":"The aim of this module is to introduce the state-of-the-art architectural advances underlying the current generation of computing systems. A review of pipelined processor design and hierarchical memory design is followed by advanced topics including exploitation of instruction-level parallelism through dynamic instruction scheduling and speculation, exploiting thread-level parallelism through\nmultiprocessors, and optimizations for memory and storage subsystems. Throughout the module, particular emphasis will be placed on cost-performance-power-reliability trade-offs in designing the different architectural components.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS3220 Computer Architecture or CS4223 Multi-core Architecture","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2030,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":110}]}]}
