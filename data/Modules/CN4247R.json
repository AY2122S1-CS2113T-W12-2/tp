{"moduleCode":"CN4247R","title":"Enzyme Technology","description":"This module will start with general introduction about enzyme, enzymatic transformation, and enzymatic process. It will be followed by various components in the development of an enzymatic process: enzyme classes and enzymatic reactions; enzyme discovery and high-throughput screening and detection methods; enzyme purification, characterisation, structure, function, and selectivity; protein engineering; cell engineering; biotransformation with isolated enzymes and microbial cells; reaction engineering; enzyme in organic solvent, two-liquid phase system, and enzyme stabilisation; cofactor regeneration; and product recovery. Finally, the students will learn process economics and industrial examples on the enzymatic production of fine chemicals.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 30, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1100,"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1100,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E5-02-32","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1300,"venue":"E5-02-32","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45}]}]}
