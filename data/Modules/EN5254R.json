{"moduleCode":"EN5254R","title":"Rethinking Failure in the 21st Century","description":"Motivated by the prevalent political, institutional, and economic failings that seem to plague our present century, best captured perhaps by the millennial-speak “epic fail,” this course proposes to critically think about failure as a concept. We will explore what is specific to contemporary failure, as compared to twentieth century failure. We will also seek to elucidate failure in all its dimensions, which would require us to articulate without prejudice all the affective states that accompany it. Readings will include literary texts by Beckett, Blanchot, Coetzee, Barnes, Carson, and DeLillo, alongside theoretical ones (French thought, contemporary feminist theory, and affect theory).","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate student in the university or with the approval of the Department.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
