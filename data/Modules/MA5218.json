{"moduleCode":"MA5218","title":"Graduate Algebra IIB","description":"This module is an introduction to representation theory of finite groups and other related topics. The first third of the course is devoted to the study of semisimple rings and algebras, culminating in the Wedderburn-Artin structure theorem. The remainder of the course is devoted to representation theory of finite groups, character theory and applications such as Burnside’s theorem. If time permits, further topics may be discussed, such as Artin’s and Brauer’s theorems, rationality questions or representations of compact groups","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA5203 or departmental approval","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 28, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"S17-0511","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":27},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"S17-0511","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":27}]}]}
