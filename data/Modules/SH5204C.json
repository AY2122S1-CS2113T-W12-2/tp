{"moduleCode":"SH5204C","title":"Industrial Safety Engineering","description":"This module provides the essentials of engineered systems and hazard controls from the early conceptual-design and construction stages, to managing and maintenance of conventional built environment (malls, schools, hospitals, and hotels), to safe operation of complex process industry (chemical and petrochemical plants). Key aspects covered include construction design for safety (DfS), design for maintainability (DfM), fall prevention and protection, lifting and material handling, inherent safer plant design, engineered mitigation and life-safety critical systems, equipment influence assessment and maintenance, alarms and safety-interlocks, safety-critical control points and safe work procedures, hazardous area and electrical equipment classifications, electrical, electrostatic and lightning protection.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
