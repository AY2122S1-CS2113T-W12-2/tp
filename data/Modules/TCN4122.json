{"moduleCode":"TCN4122","title":"Process Synthesis and Simulation","description":"This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical\nprocesses.","moduleCredit":3.0,"department":"SCALE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"TCN2116, TCN2121, TCN3124 \u0026 TCN3132","preclusion":"CN4122E","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2030,"venue":"E1-06-08","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E1-06-08","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}]}]}
