{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module is divided into two parts. The first half of the module has a comparative politics focus. It will examine the contemporary politics of South Asian states, focusing on their political culture, institutions and processes and political change and development. It will also treat issues like ethnicity, religion, regime legitimacy and the relationship between violence and democracy. By studying these issues comparatively we can discern regular patterns in the behaviour of individuals and groups and understand how their demands are processed and met. The second part of the module will adopt a thematic approach to explain the various factors that have shaped intra-regional relations. This will include the role of external powers and also the spillover effect of domestic conflicts. Foreign policy objectives of the regional states and their threat perceptions will be the principal area of focus. The module will also deal with issues of regional order and stability. The target students are those enrolled in South Asian Studies Programme and Political Science.","title":"South Asian Politics","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PS2247","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0209","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS1-0303","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-05T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
