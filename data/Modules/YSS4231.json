{"moduleCode":"YSS4231","title":"Parenting and Child Development","description":"This course examines the various aspects of parental influence on\nchildren’s development, with a focus on cultural differences in parenting\nstyles and practices. Topics to be covered include a critical evaluation of\nthe conceptual and functional differences of parenting practices across\ncultures, and how these may influence children’s development in diverse\ncontexts. The notion of “good enough parenting” and parenting as a bidirectional\nprocess will be analysed. The course concludes with a\ndiscussion of whether parents are the most important source of\ninfluence, considering the many other domains of influence in children’s\nlives, such as peers.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSS2201 Understanding Behaviour and Cognition and YSS2216 Statistics\nand Research Methods for Psychology or with the permission of the\ninstructor","preclusion":"PL4880K Parenting and Child Development","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
