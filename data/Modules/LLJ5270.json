{"moduleCode":"LLJ5270","title":"International Human Rights of Women","description":"The course examines the international legal protection of women’s human rights within a framework of international law and feminist legal theories. The course will focus upon the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 1979 to which Singapore became a party in 1995 and the work of the CEDAW Committee in monitoring and implementing the Convention. The impact of certain conceptual assumptions within international law, and human rights law in particular, that militates against the Adequate protection of women\u0027s rights will be considered. After an examination of the general framework, more detailed attention will be given to certain topics including health and reproductive rights, women’s right to education violence against women, including in armed conflict, political participation and trafficking. The course will finally consider the question of whether international human rights law is an appropriate vehicle for the furtherance of women\u0027s interests.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
