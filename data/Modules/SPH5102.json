{"moduleCode":"SPH5102","title":"Design, Conduct and Analysis of Clinical Trials","description":"In this module, issues in clinical trials, including blinding randomisation, sample size, power, ethical, regulatory, and quality-of-life issues will be addressed. Interim and sequential analyses, analysis of multiple treatments and endpoints, stratification and subgroup analyses, as well as meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials will also be discussed.
