{"moduleCode":"LLJ5082","title":"Law \u0026 Social Movements","description":"This course provides a broad understanding of the relationship between law and social movements. Why do people mobilize collectively? We begin with this question, and then consider the different approaches of conceptualizing social movements. Next, we delve into questions intersecting social movements and sociology of law: the use of law as social control and repression, the role of lawyers in social movements, legal strategies involved in collective claim?making, and the relationship between law and social change. After that, we examine a selection of case studies such as those concerning prodemocracy\nmovements, sexual rights movements, rightwing and counter movements, and transnational movements.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
