{"moduleCode":"MA5260","title":"Probability Theory II","description":"The objective of this course to introduce students the basics of Brownian motion and martingale theory. For Brownian motion, we cover topics such as existence and uniqueness of Brownian motion, Skorokhod embedding, Donsker\u0027s invariance principle, exponential martingales associated with Brownian motion, sample path properties of Brownian motion. As for martingales, we confine ourselves to discrete time parameter martingales and cover topics such as conditional expectations and their properties, martingales (submartingales and supermartinmgales), previsible processes, Doob\u0027s upcrossing lemma, Doob\u0027s martingale convergence theorem, stopping times, martingale transforms and Doob\u0027s optional sampling theorems, martingale inequalities and inequalities for martingale transforms.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA5259 or ST5214 or departmental approval","preclusion":"ST5205","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
