{"moduleCode":"LL4382V","title":"Private International Law","description":"With the internationalization of commercial and personal relationships and the increase of cross-border disputes in Singapore’s courts, a working knowledge of private international law, or the conflict of laws, has become essential for legal practice in Singapore. This course offers students a comprehensive overview of the foundations of private international law, with a particular focus on Singapore law. It covers private international law’s three main pillars - jurisdiction, choice of law and foreign judgments - and also touches on broader methodological issues, and questions of sovereignty, comity, and public policy, which undergird and define the boundaries of the field.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"Not open to anyone who has done: \nLL4030V/LL5030V/LL6030V/LLJ5030V; LL4030/LL5030/LL6030 International Commercial Litigation; LL4049V/LL5049V/LL6049V/LLJ5049V; LL4049/LL5049/LL6049 Principles of Conflict of Laws; LL4205V/LL5205V/LL6205V/LLJ5205V; LL4205/LL5205/LL6205 Maritime Conflict of Laws\nLL4454V/LL5454V/LL6454V/LLJ5454V; LL4454/LL5454/LL6454/LLJ5454 Commercial Conflict of Law at NUS Law, or a substantially similar course elsewhere.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 24, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Hybrid_D","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
