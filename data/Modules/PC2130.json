{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"Students who have passed PC2130B are not allowed to take this module, YSC3210","description":"This module provides a rigorous introduction to quantum mechanics. It covers the following list of topics: Description of quantum systems: Hilbert space; observables, eigenfunctions, the statistical interpretation, the uncertainty relations; pure and mixed states using ‚Äúdensity matrices‚Ä? and the Dirac\nnotation. Two-level systems are discussed as an example, considering Stern-Gerlach interferometer. Then the Schr√∂dinger equation and stationary states are discussed, using the free particle, the square well, barriers and the harmonic oscillator as examples. Furthermore, problems in three dimensions are discussed: spin and orbital angular momentum; the Schr√∂dinger equation in spherical coordinates; the hydrogen atom and the addition of angular momenta","title":"Quantum Mechanics I","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,1,5],"prerequisite":"Students who have either passed (PC1144 or PC1432/PC1432X) and (MA1101R or MA1513 or MA1508E) and (MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1511 or MA1512) or equivalent.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC2130","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT20","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT20","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-06T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"and":[{"or":["PC1144","PC1432","PC1432X"]},{"or":["MA1101R","MA1513","MA1508E"]},{"or":["MA1102R","MA1505","MA1511","MA1512"]}]},"fulfillRequirements":["PC3130","PC3232","PC3233","PC3235","PC3246","PC3251","QT5101","QT5102","QT5201V"]}
