{"moduleCode":"EE5137","title":"Stochastic Processes","description":"This is a course on stochastic processes. The emphasis of this course is on mathematical rigor of principles and concepts in stochastic processes with an eye towards modeling of real-world systems. Students are expected to do simple proofs in addition to rudimentary calculations. Topics include measure-theoretic probability, Poisson processes, renewal processes, Markov chains and decision theory.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"[applicable to UG level students only] EE2012 or EE2012A or ST2334; or\n\n[Advisory applicable to GD level students only] Requires knowledge of probability and statistics at the level of NUS-ECE undergraduate module EE2012 or equivalent","preclusion":"EE5306, EE5137R","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 29, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":70}]}]}
