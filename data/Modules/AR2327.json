{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Architectural form is a result of its construction, structure and materiality. Architecture emerges in a symbiosis of historical understanding of structural theory, construction, engineering and automation.\nThe Module focuses on materials and construction techniques within different environmental and climatic conditions. The fundamentals, rules of systems and principles in Construction Architecture explain constructed form. Using additive manufacturing new possibilities in prefabrication and modular elements will be explored. Lectures on Structural and Design Logic accompany seminar assignments and cover in greater depth, important aspects of Architectural Construction and Systems of Prefabrication, whereby 3D printing is used to generate new structural typologies, applicable and necessary for the integration into the Architectural Design Studio.","title":"Architectural Tectonics","department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","workload":[2,2,0,6,0],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"AR2327","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SDE4-EXR-1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SDE1-SR2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"10","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Hybrid_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SDE1-SR3","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"5","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Hybrid_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"5","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SDE1-SR5-6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SDE4-EXR-2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"]}]}
