{"moduleCode":"PP5236","title":"Poverty, Inequality, and Public Policy","description":"The objective of this module is to get an understanding of what is poverty, how to measure poverty, who is poor, what causes poverty, and what are the policy responses to poverty alleviation. In addition, the module will also examine the concept of inequality and its interlinkages with poverty. The module will combine theory, measurement, and policy with an emphasis on policy examples from Asia.\n\nIn addition to introducing students to mainstream conceptualizations of poverty and inequality such as predetermined poverty lines and Gini index, this module will bring in contemporary and alternative paradigms such as multi-dimensional poverty, capability deprivation, and inequality of opportunity.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
