{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"LI5202 Supply Chain Management Strategies and Case Studies","description":"Interest in supply chain management, both in industry and in academia, has grown rapidly over the past three decades, and continues to grow. While many companies recognize the importance of analysing their supply chains, most of them perform the analysis using experience and intuition with very few analytical models. In contrast, the academic community has developed various models and tools for supply chain management. This course intends to fill this gap by discussing state-of-the-art models, strategies, and solution methods that are important for supply chain management. Impact of trade tension and disruption caused by COVID-19 will be discussed too.","title":"Supply Chain Models and Strategies","department":"Analytics and Operations","faculty":"NUS Business School","workload":[3,0,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"DOS5106","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"A1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ1-0204","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":65,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
