{"moduleCode":"LL5303","title":"Law and Literature","description":"This course explores the complex interactions between\nliterature and the law. Even though the two disciplines may\nseem distinct, both law and literature are products of\nlanguage and have overlapped in significant and\ninteresting ways in history. Why do legal themes recur in\nfiction, and what kinds of literary structures underpin legal\nargumentation? How do novelists and playwrights imagine\nthe law, and how do lawyers and judges interpret literary\nworks? Could literature have legal subtexts, and could\nlegal documents be re-interpreted as literary texts? We will\nthink through these questions by juxtaposing fiction,\ndrama, legal cases, and critical theory.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"LL4303V/LL5303V/LL6303V Law and Literature","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
