{"moduleCode":"PP5526","title":"The Politics of Infrastructure","description":"This module addresses the role infrastructure plays in society, and how it shapes power relations. By combining approaches from history and Science and Technology Studies (STS), it aims to equip students with a multi-disciplinary skill set needed to understand the diverse range of issues undergirding infrastructural projects, politics, and policies. The module examines how ethnography has helped us understand large organisations; how humanity has overcome logistical challenges in different geographical and temporal contexts; the different kinds of infrastructure, including communication, water, bureaucracy, and knowledge infrastructures; China’s Belt and Road Initiative; and new computing and digitalization technologies under ‘Industry 4.0’.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
