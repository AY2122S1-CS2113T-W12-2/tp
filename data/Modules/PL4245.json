{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"DSA1101 Introduction to Data Science \nBT1101 Introduction to Business Analytics","description":"The course aims to introduce psychology students to modern methods of prediction called data science or machine learning. The module will cover both the foundations of these methods and their use in areas of applied interest to social scientists such as psychometrics. The methods covered include regularized regression, trees and random forests, neural networks, and support vector machines. The module will focus not on derivations and proofs, but instead on gaining an intuitive conceptual understanding of the techniques, how and when to use them for data analysis, and how to assess performance of these methods.","title":"Data Science for Psychology: Methods and Applications","department":"Psychology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,4,5.5],"prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs of which student must have passed PL1101E, PL2131, PL2132 and 4 out of the 5 core modules (PL3232/PL3102 - PL3236/PL3106), with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"PL4245","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D5","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS3-0214","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT14","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D5","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS4-B107","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS4-B107","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D4","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS4-0116","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS4-B107","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
