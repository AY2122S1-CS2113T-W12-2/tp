{"moduleCode":"YSS4207","title":"Creative Cities","description":"This course examines the relationship between urbanization and the creative industries. Increasingly urban economic growth, built environment regeneration and community development operate in and through the logics of creativity, be they expressive spectacles, arts festivals, branding, or state-led/community-based arts initiatives. This course explores the link between the arts and urban development, examining it historically and in a range of contemporary contexts. Students will both analyze the causes of the rise of creative industries-led urbanization economically and socially, as well participate as urban creatives through various media.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
