Students can make requests to cover topics that are of interest to them. This is an ideal setting for Ph.D. students to try out their thesis research topics. Topics such as Bayesian econometrics, panel regression with unit-root time series, and macroeconometric modelling for forecasting and policy analyses are likely to be covered under this module.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"EC5154/EC5103","preclusion":"EC6204","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
