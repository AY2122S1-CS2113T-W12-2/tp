{"moduleCode":"SC2225","title":"The Social Life of Art","description":"Art and anthropology have had a long, if at times,\ncontentious history of exchanges, from selective\nappropriations to inventive collaborations. This\nmodule explores the vibrant relationship between art\nand anthropology to think about what each still can\nlearn from the other. We start with a historical\nexamination of the exchanges between two disciplines\nover the 20th century, from the use of ethnographic\ntropes by artists to avant-garde influences on\nanthropological practices of representation. We then\nturn to the deeper affinities with between the two as\nfound in the ethnographic turn in art,\nart/anthropology collaborations, and, more recently,\nthe social/participatory/relational turn.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 4, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS1-0201","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS1-0304","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS8-0402","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
