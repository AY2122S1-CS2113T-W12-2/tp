{"moduleCode":"LSM4254","title":"Principles of Taxonomy and Systematics","description":"This module introduces students to taxonomy and systematics; i.e., the science of grouping biodiversity into species, describing the species, and classifying this\ndiversity into higher-level taxa that reflect evolutionary history. The module has two main goals: (1) It introduces the main concepts and goals of taxonomy and\nsystematics. (2) It teaches the qualitative and quantitative techniques that are today used to describe/identify species and higher-level taxa based on the analysis of\nmorphological and DNA sequence evidence. The aim is to equip environmental as well as other biologists with a thorough understanding of taxonomic/systematic units and the tools needed for evaluating and quantifying diversity in samples of plant and animal specimens.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"LSM3241 or LSM3252","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
