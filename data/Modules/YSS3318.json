{"moduleCode":"YSS3318","title":"The Philosophy of Simone de Beauvoir","description":"This course is primarily devoted to a close reading of Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex. It offers students the opportunity to engage in a rigorous reading of this text to understand her analysis of the Western philosophical and historical construction of “Woman.” This course will examine her understanding of how the Western patriarchy works via social norms and economic structures, but also via myths and stories about “Woman.” We will also explore her critical engagements with Marxism, Hegelianism, psychoanalysis, and Existentialism.  We will then read her work, The Ethics of Ambiguity, to understand her unique contribution to ethical philosophy.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
