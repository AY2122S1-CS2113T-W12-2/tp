{"moduleCode":"PC5214","title":"Essential techniques in experimental physics","description":"The ability to setup high-quality experiments and measurements is fundamental to innovation in many areas of sciences and engineering, including materials and devices.  Therefore a good understanding of, and practical training, in experimental physics techniques is essential to a lot of research and development work in both academia and industry.  This course equips students with the essential knowledge and practical skills in a broad range of modern experimental physics techniques, including:  mechanical design and materials selection; vacuum technology, cyostats, and thin-film deposition techniques; Gaussian beam laser optics; photodetectors; stepper motors and piezoelectric actuators; feedback and control loops; techniques in analog, digital and pulse signal processing; weak-signal detection and lock-in amplifiers; fast-signal detection and transmission lines.  The practical skills will be taught in laboratory classes, which are part of this course.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"A basic background in optics is recommended","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S11-0205","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S11-0205","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
