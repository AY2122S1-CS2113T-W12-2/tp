It also enables students to practice and improve the skills of technical report writing and oral presentation. The objective of the design project is to provide an opportunity for students to gain practical experience in an actual industry problem. It also gives the students a broader scope in applying industrial engineering concepts rather than concentrating on one particular subject area.","title":"Systems Design Project","department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[0,0,0,4,6],"prerequisite":"IE2100, IE2110 and IE2111","moduleCredit":"8","moduleCode":"IE3100R","attributes":{"year":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT2","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["IE2100","IE2110","IE2111"]}}
