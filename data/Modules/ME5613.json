{"moduleCode":"ME5613","title":"Optimal Design of Multi-Functional Structures","description":"This module focuses on analysis, optimal design techniques and fabrication methods of multi-functional structures and devices. The underlying principles of\ncalculus of variations, constrained minimization, and design parameterization and solution methods of topology optimization will be fully studied. Key applications include compliant structures/mechanisms and multi-material soft robots. These devices lie at the interface of principles and procedures of structures and machines. The module will bring out methodologies for designing multi-functional structures/machines and fabrication techniques of 3D printing.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Finite Element Methods or Structural Analysis or Solid Mechanics or an equivalent","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
