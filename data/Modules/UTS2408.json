{"moduleCode":"UTS2408","title":"Unequal Parenthoods in Asia","description":"Does parenting come naturally? Are there significant cultural differences in parenting practices, between Singapore, Asia more broadly, and the West? Do women parent differently from men?  In this module, students will see that parenting may be universal but also a diverse experience. Drawing on case studies from Singapore, and other Asian societies, we examine how parenting roles and styles and perceptions of parenting are differentially produced across time, place and context. Using an interdisciplinary approach, students will learn how broader systems of inequality through institutions, policies, experts, technology and material resources perpetuate socially stratified and fragmented experiences of parenting.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"CAPT-SR3","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":6},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"CAPT-SR1-2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":6},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"CAPT-SR1-2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":6},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"CAPT-SR3","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":6}]}]}
