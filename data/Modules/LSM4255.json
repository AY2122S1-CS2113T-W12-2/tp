{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The use of mathematics has a long history in the life sciences, allowing scientists to clearly articulate their assumptions, rigorously test their ideas about how biological systems work, and make predictions. In this module, students will explore both current and classical questions in mathematical biology, such\nas: What factors constrain and contribute to the species diversity of an ecosystem? Under what conditions can we expect the stable coexistence of predator and prey populations, or competitors in an ecosystem? What proportion of a human population do we have to vaccinate to prevent an epidemic?","title":"Methods in Mathematical Biology","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,0,2,2,4],"prerequisite":"LSM2253 Applied Data Analysis in Ecology and Evolution","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LSM4255","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S2-04LAB5","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-12-02T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180}],"prereqTree":"LSM2253"}
