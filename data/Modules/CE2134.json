{"moduleCode":"CE2134","title":"Fluid Mechanics","description":"The first part introduces students to the basic concepts of fluid mechanics. Starting with fluid properties and fluid statics, students’ progress to the conservation laws which allows them to analyse various fluid problems encountered in engineering practice. The second half of the module then introduces students to basic fluid flow concepts. Student are taught how to apply the prior concepts and laws to pipe flows, hydraulic machinery and pipe networks. At the end students should be able to estimate frictional losses for flows in pipelines, design pumping systems and apply the obtained knowledge to other engineering applications.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"ME2134 Fluid Mechanics I\nTCE2134","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 22, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"02","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45},{"classNo":"03","startTime":1500,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45},{"classNo":"03","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"EW1-02-03","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"02","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"EW1-02-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1700,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1200,"endTime":1300,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"EW1-02-03","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20}]}]}
