{"moduleCode":"YSS1208","title":"Deviance and Conformity: An Introduction to Sociology","description":"Why are some behaviors, differences, and people considered deviant or stigmatized while others are not? This introductory sociology module examines several theories of social deviance that offer different answers to this question. We will focus on the creation of deviant categories and persons as interactive processes involving how behaviors are labeled as deviant, how people enter deviant roles, how others respond to deviance, and how those labeled as deviant cope with these responses.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
