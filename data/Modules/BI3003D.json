It is accessible to students for academic credit even if they had previously completed BI3001 or BI3002. (In contrast to BI3003, BI3001 and BI3002 deal with internships that are related to business).","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"This internship module is open to NUS business school undergraduate students who have completed at least 60MCs and plan to do an approved internship between 10-12 weeks in duration, during the vacation period.\n\nStudents should attend and complete one of two not-for-credit Business Finishing School (BFS) modules.","preclusion":"Full-time NUS business school undergraduate students who have accumulated more than 12 MCs for previous internship stints under BI3001 and/or BI3002.\n\nFull-time NUS business school undergraduate students who have previously completed a BI3003 internship.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
