{"moduleCode":"UTC2723","title":"How would YOU lead?","description":"This Senior Seminar is a dialogue about leaders and leadership in the future workplace. It takes students’ lived experience and encounters with leaders as starting points; and considers what the literature, experts, and leaders from different domains may have said/demonstrated about leadership. The stories and examples of leadership are drawn from multiple domains (e.g. politics, education, social enterprise, business). A key module goal is to integrate varied instances of leadership and contexts, that will help everyone arrive at their own response to the questions, “how would YOU lead? What kind of leader will you be, how, and why?” (98 words)","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","preclusion":"UTC27%","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1300,"venue":"RC4-SR1-2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":14}]}]}
