{"moduleCode":"EE4101","title":"RF Communications","description":"Radio and microwave systems are used for information transmission.  This module therefore introduces the student to a broad range of enabling knowledge and skills commonly employed by RF and microwave engineers to specify, analyse and design radio and microwave transmission systems.  Topics covered:  Time-varying EM fields: guided waves, evanescent modes and plane-wave propagation. Radiation: radiation mechanism, magnetic vector potential, current distribution on a thin wire, Hertzian dipole, Half-wave dipole \u0026 monopole. RF Antennas: parameters, aperture antennas and arrays.  RF Amplification: stability, gain and small-signal narrowband design.  RF Generation:  conditions for oscillation, oscillator design and dielectric resonators.   RF Receivers:  receiver and mixer parameters.  RF Systems: system gain and noise figure, satellite and terrestrial systems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"PC2020","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 23, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1000,"endTime":1100,"venue":"E5-03-22","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E5-03-22","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":30}]}]}
