{"moduleCode":"PS4211","title":"Political Theology","description":"Political theology is a mode of inquiry that interprets politics in the context of theological concepts and categories. This module focuses on Christian theological debates, in the late medieval and early modern periods, and considers their impact on the vocabulary of contemporary politics and international relations. Representative topics include: state sovereignty, political rule, extra-legal action, and international order. In recovering this theological inheritance this module dispels widely held myths about the origins of this vocabulary and reinterprets canonical figures in this light. In doing so, it challenges the narrative of progressive secularisation that dominates modern Western political and international thought.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS4-0206","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
