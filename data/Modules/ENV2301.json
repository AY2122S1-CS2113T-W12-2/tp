{"moduleCode":"ENV2301","title":"Methods and Techniques for Environmental Studies","description":"Environmental studies integrate a wide range of disciplines and this is reflected in the approaches applied for collecting the data required for answering questions and hypotheses. This module will introduce key methods and techniques used in human and physical geography, and in field and experimental ecology. Students will gain hands on experience in the design, execution and analysis of surveys and experiments. The research methods and techniques taught in this module will be specially selected for, and applied to, environmental questions and context. An awareness of what types of research are realistic given time and resource constraints will be developed.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"ENV1101 – Environmental Studies – An Interdisciplinary Overview","preclusion":"ENV2101 – Global Environmental Change","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT32","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
