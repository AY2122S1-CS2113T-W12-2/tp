From living rooms to stadiums, sports extend to a multitude of arenas to influence economies, politics, and cultures as well as the everyday lives of many individuals. This course is designed to provide students the ability to evaluate the relationship between sports and society. Students do not need a background in sociology nor knowledge about the technicalities of sports to benefit from the module.
