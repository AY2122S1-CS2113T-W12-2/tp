{"moduleCode":"PH3302","title":"Chinese Philosophical Traditions 2","description":"This second half of a two-part course on Chinese\n\nPhilosophical Traditions focuses on Early Modern\n\nChinese Philosophy. This module focuses on the\n\nchanges in the Confucian tradition between the\n\nlate Tang through the Qing. We cover the main\n\nfigures in Neo-Confucianism, and examine in\n\ndetail the philosophies of Zhu Xi (1130-1200) and\n\nWang Yangming (1472-1529). We close with a\n\ndiscussion of the philological turn in the Qing\n\ndynasty. We treat these thinkers and their ideas\n\nin their proper historical contexts and evaluate\n\ntheir philosophies critically. We also address and\n\nassess the relevance of these ideas to\n\ncontemporary philosophical debates.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"PH2302","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
