{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Utilizing the critical lenses of anthropology and ethnography, this course examines how Islam influences culture and society in the contemporary world. We will study different social contexts, from the Middle East to Southeast Asia and the Western world, to investigate how ordinary Muslims grapple with their religious commitments and other demands of everyday life. We will analyze how the interplay between the religious and non-religious dimensions of Muslim life unfold in fields as diverse as art and aesthetic production, finance and banking, organ transplantation, law and politics, resource extraction and environmental protection, and expressions of gender and sexual identities.","title":"Anthropology of Islam","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,4.5,5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3330","semesterData":[]}
