{"moduleCode":"MA1506","title":"Mathematics II","description":"[Module is no longer offered] This module introduces the basic concepts of developing mathematical models for engineering systems and trains students on techniques in differential equations and linear algebra for solving the resulting equations. The objective is to provide mathematical foundations for numerical solution of complex engineering problems. This modelling module is to be driven from engineering systems perspective and expose students to methodology to identify appropriate simplifications in system modelling that lead to simplified mathematical description from a more comprehensive one. The module develops methods on first and second order differential equations, linear algebra and Laplace transform based on their applications in engineering systems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Read MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1521","preclusion":"MA1101R, MA1311, MA2312, MA1508, MA2501, EE1461, PC2174, MA1511, MA1512, MA1513, MA1508E","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
