{"moduleCode":"EC3385","title":"Maritime and Shipping Economics","description":"International transportation has evolved into a complex system involving ocean carriers, ports, terminals and multimodal transport intermediaries.  In such networks, major container hubs, such as this of Singapore, play a crucial role as \u0027nodes\u0027 and trans-shipment centres.  Nowadays, the optimization of global supply chains requires a holistic approach to shipping through the study of what has come to be known as Maritime Economics and Logistics (MEL).  The course follows this approach, focusing on liner (container) shipping, its operations, structure and regulatory environment.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"EC2101","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
