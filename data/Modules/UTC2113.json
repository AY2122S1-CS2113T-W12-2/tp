{"moduleCode":"UTC2113","title":"Gaming Life","description":"Games permeate disparate fields of knowledge and involve cultural practices that are part of everyday life. This module invites students to think creatively and expansively about what it means to “play a game” beyond the usual connotations of the activity. It explores games in theoretical and practical ways to develop questions interrelating politics, technologies, knowledge, and power. Further explorations find domains in life that open themselves up to the idea of “play,” including political and social games. Seminarians will be equipped with theoretical and philosophical vocabulary with which they will engage in the construction, critique, and playing of games. They will think through questions like: What can constitute a game? What does it mean to win, lose, or cheat in a game? What are the stakes involved in thinking of life as a game? Relatedly, what does it mean to consider gaming systems that govern life?","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"GEM1902% or GEM1912% or UTC11%","preclusion":"GEM2902% or GEM2905% or GEM2907% or GEM2908% or GEM2909% or GEM2910% or UTC21%","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1300,"venue":"TC-SR6","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1600,"venue":"TC-SR6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16}]}]}
