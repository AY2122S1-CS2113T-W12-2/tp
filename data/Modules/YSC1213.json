{"moduleCode":"YSC1213","title":"General Physics","description":"This introductory physics course uses the platform of hands-on\nelectronics to introduce students to concepts in electro-magnetism\nincluding electrostatics and electrodynamics. Using electronic\ncomponents to build linear and non-linear oscillators, students will be\nintroduced to concepts in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. The\ncourse is intended for both science majors and also non-majors.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC1216 Calculus or with the permission of the instructor.","preclusion":"PC1221 Fundamentals of Physics I \u0026 PC1222 Fundamentals of Physics II","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 22, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":180,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1100,"venue":"Y-CompLab","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1100,"venue":"Y-CompLab","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
