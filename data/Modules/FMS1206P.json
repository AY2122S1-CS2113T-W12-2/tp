{"moduleCode":"FMS1206P","title":"Energy Storage Devices - State of the Art","description":"Increased mechanization has simplified our daily lives\nsignificantly, but their high energy consumption nature has\nalso raised concerns about depleting fossil fuels (currently\nthe main source of energy). Research is being carried out\nworldwide to find alternate sources of energy. Solar and\nwind energy sound most promising but their intermittent\nnature is a major drawback. To counter this, significant\nR\u0026D is being done to devise efficient energy storage\ndevices. This module attempts to give an overview of\nalternate energy systems and highlight the importance of\nenergy storage devices. Principle of operation, R\u0026D and\nfuture trends, merits and limitations of various energy\nstorage systems will be discussed. Pumped storage\ndevices, fuel cells, batteries and their types, super\ncapacitors and hydrogen storage will be focused upon.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","preclusion":"Students who have read a Freshman Seminar before will be precluded from reading a second Freshman Seminar.\n\nStudents staying in Residential Colleges in UTown who will be reading or have read the Junior Seminars will be precluded from reading Freshman Seminar in the Faculty.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Hybrid_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}]}]}
