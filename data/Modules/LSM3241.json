{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module introduces practical, real-world genomic data analysis: when a genomic experiment is performed, and bioinformatics analysis is required, how is it done? In â€œData Access and Integrationâ€?, students will learn how to distinguish databases and integrate data. In â€œGenomics and NGSâ€?, students will learn practical analysis of microarray and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Students will learn how to map sequencing data to genomes in a variety of problem settings and interpret results. In â€œIntegrative Analysisâ€?, students will learn how approaches including pathway analysis and analysis of gene regulatory networks can add power to interpretation of genomic experiments.","title":"Genomic Data Analysis","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,1,2,3,2],"prerequisite":"LSM2241","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LSM3241","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"S2-04LAB5","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"]}],"prereqTree":"LSM2241","fulfillRequirements":["LSM4241","LSM4254","ZB4171"]}
