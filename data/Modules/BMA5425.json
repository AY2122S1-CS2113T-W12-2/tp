{"moduleCode":"BMA5425","title":"Social Entrepreneurship","description":"Despite the proliferation of commercial enterprises out there, we still witness huge segments of the human population that cannot meet their basic human needs. Access to healthcare, sanitation, education, knowledge, water and other basic services remain challenging to most of the world’s population. Social exclusion of the disadvantaged groups (such as special needs, ex-offenders and youth-at-risks) are still thorny issues that societies have to grapple with. While most would consider the pivotal role of the governments in managing these challenges, individuals can also make a difference to underserved populations. This module focuses on social entrepreneurship that creates and implements effective, scalable and sustainable solutions to address such issues and meet the needs of the disadvantaged groups in the society. In the module, students will learn about different models, examples and ways of thinking about social entrepreneurship.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
