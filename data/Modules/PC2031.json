{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"YSC3211, PC2131","description":"Among the four fundamental forces in nature, the electromagnetic force has great technological importance and is critical for the understanding of many subjects in Engineering and Science. This essential module for Physics majors is intended for students who wish to acquire a deep understanding of Electricity and Magnetism. It considers the fundamentals of Electricity and Magnetism and covers topics such as: electrostatic fields, Coulomb’s law and Poisson’s equation; magnetostatic fields, Biot-Savart’s law and Poisson’s equation; time-varying electric and magnetic fields, Faraday’s and generalised Ampere’s laws; Maxwell’s equations and electromagnetic waves in vacuum. Knowledge from PC2032 is desirable.","title":"Electricity & Magnetism I","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,1,5],"prerequisite":"(PC1101 or PC1432) and H2 Mathematics/Further Mathematics or equivalent","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC2031","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT32","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT32","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-04-26T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["PC1101","PC1432"]}}
