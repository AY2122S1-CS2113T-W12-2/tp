{"moduleCode":"EL4212","title":"Field Methods in Linguistics","description":"This module develops practical skills in linguistic fieldwork. The centrepiece of the module is the investigation of an unfamiliar language through structured interviews with native speakers. Students will elicit, record, transcribe, and organize linguistic data. Together we will gain a basic understanding of aspects of the grammar of the language. Students will also develop original hypotheses regarding the language’s structure, test these hypotheses, and share their findings through written reports. Ethical issues that arise in conducting linguistic fieldwork will also be discussed.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in EL, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","preclusion":"EL3212","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"AS5-0309","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
