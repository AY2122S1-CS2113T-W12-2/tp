{"moduleCode":"YHU3342","title":"Integrative Music Theory 2","description":"This course furnishes students who are already familiar with music fundamentals with the opportunity to learn to develop intermediate knowledge and skills, with a focus on practical transference into their lives as music performers and listeners. Notated and improvisational assignments will be given as exercises to further students’ familiarity with musical concepts and materials. It is designed to continue on from Integrative Music Theory 1, but students who have not taken this course may still be allowed to enroll in Integrative Music Theory 2 with the instructor’s permission, provided that they can demonstrate the necessary musical competency and knowledge. To cater to diverse student interests and backgrounds, application of theoretical concepts will be addressed as they occur in Western art music, experimental music, pop, jazz, and Carnatic music.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YHU2205 Integrative Music Theory 1 or with the permission of the instructor.","preclusion":"YHU2210 Integrative Music Theory 2","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1030,"endTime":1200,"venue":"Y-PracRm6","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":6},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1030,"endTime":1200,"venue":"Y-PracRm6","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":6}]}]}
