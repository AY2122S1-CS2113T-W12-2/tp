{"moduleCode":"CN4221R","title":"Control of Industrial Processes","description":"This module will give students sound knowledge and appreciation of the development of plant-wide control (PWC) systems for chemical processes. The course will cover the systematic design of a regulatory control system with the aid of heuristics and computer-aided simulation tools. Students will be introduced to dynamic (real-time) simulation of chemical processes. Active learning techniques will be employed throughout. As part of the assessment, students will get to work hands-on with a project to design and simulate PWC systems for a chemical plant. Students are also assessed by means of a class test, and small individual assignments.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CN3121: Process Dynamics and Control\nCN4122: Process Synthesis and Simulation","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"LT4","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"LT4","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1400,"venue":"LT4","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]}]}
