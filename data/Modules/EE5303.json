{"moduleCode":"EE5303","title":"Microwave Electronics","description":"With emphasis on fundamentals, this module develops analysis methods that are used to understand the operation and design of solid-state microwave electronic circuits commonly used in microwave systems.  Methods for simulating nonlinear microwave circuits and processing of circuit parameters will be discussed. Major topics include: Linear circuit parameter conversion. Analysis of nonlinear microwave circuits. Lossy match, lossy feedback, distributed and power amplifiers. Oscillator theory; diode and transistor oscillators. Frequency multiplication, division and synthesis.  Microwave frequency conversion, mixer analysis, single-ended and balanced mixers, diode and transistor mixers, image rejection, mixer noise.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"[applicable to UG level students only] EE4101 or EE4104 or EE4112; or\n\n[Advisory pre-req applicable to GD level students only] Requires background knowledge such as EE4101, EE4104 or EE4112 or equivalent.","preclusion":"EE5303R","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 27, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]}]}
