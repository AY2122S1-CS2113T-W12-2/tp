{"moduleCode":"MA5236","title":"Homology Theory","description":"This module is designed for graduate students in mathematics.  It covers the following major topics:  Homological algebra: categories and functors, chain complexes, homology, exact sequences, Snake Lemma, Mayer-Vietoris, Kunneth Theorem.  Homology theory:  Eilenberg-Steenrod homology axioms, singular homology theory, cellular homology, cohomology, cup and cap products, applications of homology (Brouwer fixed-point theorem, vector fields on spheres, Jordan Curve Theorem), H-spaces and Hopf algebra.  Manifolds: de Rham cohomology, orientation, Poincare duality.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA5209 or MA5210 or departmental approval","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
