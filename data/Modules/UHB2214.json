This module seeks to examine some of these biases and how they affect our decision making as we re-look at decision making theories. In this module, we seek answers to the question of, “What constitutes a good decision and what makes for a good decision maker?”\nWe will also discuss the implications of these biases from the social welfare perspective and explores how we can overcome these biases.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"UTSRC-LT53","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"UTSRC-LT53","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30}]}]}
