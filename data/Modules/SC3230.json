{"moduleCode":"SC3230","title":"Volunteer Workforce","description":"A flourishing modern society can be promoted by volunteerism and civic engagement. Considering that volunteerism is perceived as a crucial indicator of livable society, it has been a concern of many countries including Singapore to promote volunteering among citizens. Mainly through various non-profit voluntary organizations, volunteer workforce helps attain the goal of civic, livable, and harmonious society. This module thus pursues three main themes: (1) the relationship between civil society and civic engagement, (2) the precursors of volunteer workforce (i.e., what makes people volunteer?), and (3) the outcomes of volunteerism (e.g., life satisfaction, health, and status attainment).","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS3-0215","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS7-0119","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS4-0118","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
