{"moduleCode":"EE2028A","title":"C Programming","description":"This is a first course that introduces programming in C\nlanguage. It exposes fundamental programming\nmethodologies to be followed which involves capturing the\nspecifications provided, designing and scripting a solution,\ncoding and compiling towards solving real-life complex\nproblems. Emphasis will be given on problems in\nElectrical Engineering topics. Topics in the module\ninclude, introduction to C language programming\nconstructs (variables, types, expressions, assignments,\nfunctions, arrays, structures, basic pointer operations\netc.), writing pseudo-codes, problem solving using\nElectrical Engineering applications, program development,\ncoding, testing and debugging facilitating a design\ntowards solving complex problems.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","corequisite":"CS1010E","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1500,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1500,"endTime":1700,"venue":"LT2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1000,"venue":"LT2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50},{"classNo":"02","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40}]}]}
