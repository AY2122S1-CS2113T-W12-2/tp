{"moduleCode":"BMS5411","title":"Judgment and Decision Making Under Uncertainty","description":"The decisions you make every day will shape your life. In an organisation, the decisions you make will impact outcomes for you, your team, and cumulatively affect the trajectory of your career. This module aims to help you navigate the pathways of decision making in organisations. We will adopt an evidence-based approach, tapping several streams of research – including behavioural psychology and economics, error management, and intuitive judgment – to give a rigorous account of what separates good decisions from the rest. These conceptual tools will empower you to make good decisions in an uncertain world, to influence, and to lead.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"BIZ1-0304","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40}]}]}
