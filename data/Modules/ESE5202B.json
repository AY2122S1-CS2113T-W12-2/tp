{"moduleCode":"ESE5202B","title":"Air Quality Engineering","description":"In pursuit of the broad goal of avoiding the adverse effects of\nair pollution in a cost-effective manner, air quality engineers\nare involved in a wide range of activities, including (1)\ncreating technical knowledge, (2) designing and applying air\npollution control technologies, and (3) developing air\npollution control strategies. The course will equip students\nwith practical knowledge on the design and applications of\nair pollution control systems to reduce emissions of\nparticulate matter, volatile organic compounds, oxides of\nnitrogen, and sulfur dioxide from static mobile sources. In\naddition, students will gain exposure to air pollution models.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":3,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E4-04-03","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4-04-02","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4-04-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E4-04-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E4-04-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E4-04-03","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4-04-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1830,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E3-06-08","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
