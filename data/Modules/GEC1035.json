{"moduleCode":"GEC1035","title":"Patrons of the Arts","description":"This course is a conceptual and practical introduction to the complex networks that drive \"patronage,\" including multifarious kinds of patronage. Issues raised and debated include exploring money, religion, politics, social classes, and many other social constructs that influence what art people support, and why they, especially you, support different kinds of art. Students will need to grasp and evaluate critically each set of issues that drive and affect patronage of the arts, and demonstrate their critical understanding of the interplay of these factors through written assessments, classroom discussions, and contributions to blog postings related to the module materials.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","preclusion":"GEM1029, MUL2102, GET1019","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
