{"moduleCode":"MA2219","title":"Introduction to Geometry","description":"This module gives a first introduction to various kinds of\n\ngeometries ranging from elementary Euclidean geometry\n\non the plane, inversive geometry on the sphere, as well as\n\nprojective geometry and Non-Euclidean geometry. Topics\n\ncovered include: Conics, Quadric surfaces, Affine\n\ngeometry, Affine transformations, Ceva\u0027s theorem,\n\nMenelaus\u0027 theorem, Projective geometry, projective\n\ntransformations, homogeneous coordinates, cross-ratio,\n\nPappus\u0027 theorem, Desargues\u0027 theorem, duality and\n\nprojective conics, Pascal\u0027s theorem, Brianchon\u0027s theorem,\n\nInversions, coaxal family of circles, Non-Euclidean\n\ngeometry, Mobius transformations, distance and area in\n\nNon-Euclidean geometry.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA1100 or MA1100T or MA1101R or MA2001 or MA1506 or MA1508 or MA1508E or MA1513 or MA1102R or MA2002 or MA1505 or MA1507 or MA1511 or CS1231 or CS1231S","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 27, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1100,"endTime":1200,"venue":"S17-0404","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S17-0512","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S17-0512","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
