{"moduleCode":"AR3614","title":"Sustainable Urbanism in Asia","description":"What is sustainable urbanism in Asia? How is it shaped by the diverse socio-cultural and\neconomic political configurations in Asia? This module will investigate the above questions\nby exploring the different paradigms of sustainable development and urbanism. This\nmodule will understand how different actors and organisations – from state agencies to\ncorporations, from non-governmental organisations to community organisations – construct and practice sustainable urbanism through first-hand experience from site visits and field investigations.\n\nThis module offers a situated interdisciplinary understanding of the complexity of sustainable urbanism in Asia. It is designed for students who are interested in both Asia and environmentalism.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
