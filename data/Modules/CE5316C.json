{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module introduces biophysical principles regulating exchanges of water, energy, and elements in the soilplant-atmosphere continuum and their mathematical descriptions. The presented material will address different spatial scales from a single tree up to global scale and different temporal scales from minutes to decades. Essential features of plant microclimate and plant hydraulic transport, soil hydrology, and terrestrial ecology will be introduced. The module will also provide the foundations to carry out numerical simulations of water and carbon fluxes with state-of-the-art models.","title":"Eco-hydrology","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"CE3132 Water Resources Engineering, or equivalent","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"CE5316C","attributes":{"grsu":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E1-06-04","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2021-11-29T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":90}],"prereqTree":"CE3132"}
