{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course will examine the rise of the Japanese department store during Japan's transformation during the first decades of the 20th century (1910s-30s). The department store acted as a beacon for modernization for the urban Japanese and had facilitated the onset of consumer culture. We will also examine commercial art, such as posters and advertisements, to study how artists navigated visualising new conceptions of modern Japan, and how the concept of 'design' began to form. The course will involve close readings and analysis of visual materials, historical artefacts, literature and film from the early- to mid- twentieth centuries.","title":"The Birth of the Japanese Department Store","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3.5,6],"prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
