{"moduleCode":"CE5315","title":"Climate Science for Engineers","description":"This module introduces fundamental mathematical and physical elements of the Earth climate with specific focus on clouds, precipitation, energy budget, planetary boundary layer and extreme weather phenomena. This knowledge is relevant for a better assessment of water and energy resources and impact assessments. Beyond introducing fundamental climatic processes, the module provides methods for the stochastic generation of climatic variables in a stationary and changing climate. It finally discusses broadly issues related to greenhouses gas emissions and future climate projections, outlining causes and potential solutions.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CE3132 Water Resources Engineering or equivalent.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 23, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"EA-06-04","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
