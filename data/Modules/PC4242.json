{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This advanced module presents the fundamentals of classical electrodynamics in much depth. It covers the following topics: relativistic formulation of the electromagnetic field, covariance of electrodynamics, conservation laws, radiation by moving charges, Lienard-Wiechert potentials, Larmor's formula, angular distribution of radiation, spectral properties of radiation, Cherenkov radiation, Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron radiation, multipole expansions, and applications. A good mathematical foundation is required.","title":"Electricity and Magnetism III","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,1,5],"prerequisite":"PC3231","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC4242","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S12-0403","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S12-0403","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-04T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"PC3231"}
