{"moduleCode":"PC4242","title":"Electricity and Magnetism III","description":"This advanced module presents the fundamentals of classical electrodynamics in much depth. It covers the following topics: relativistic formulation of the electromagnetic field, covariance of electrodynamics, conservation laws, radiation by moving charges, Lienard-Wiechert potentials, Larmor\u0027s formula, angular distribution of radiation, spectral properties of radiation, Cherenkov radiation, Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron radiation, multipole expansions, and applications. A good mathematical foundation is required.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC3231","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 4, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"S12-0403","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"S12-0403","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45}]}]}
