{"moduleCode":"DOS5101","title":"Supply Chain Coordination and Risk Management","description":"Supply chains have become far-flung and global as companies expand their operations to new markets and new supply sources. Concurrently, a number of macro-trends are emerging and evolving which cause changes to traditional supply chains structures and assumptions. These include: rising costs in the usual outsourcing manufacturing sites, entering into emerging markets, changing country regulations and regional trade agreements, impact of technologies on new business models and process changes, cross-border M\u0026A, and emerging marketing companies expanding regionally, etc.\nCompanies will have to continuously evaluate their strategies and adapt their supply chains to deal with these changes. They will need to improve their flexibility, coordination, and responsiveness to deal with the risks and opportunities.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Analytics and Operations","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"Knowledge in Operations Management and Supply Chain Management\nKnowledge of Calculus and Probability","preclusion":"DSC5211A","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"A1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":65},{"classNo":"A1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"BIZ2-0509","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":65}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"BIZ2-B104","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":65}]}]}
