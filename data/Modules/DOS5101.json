Concurrently, a number of macro-trends are emerging and evolving which cause changes to traditional supply chains structures and assumptions. These include: rising costs in the usual outsourcing manufacturing sites, entering into emerging markets, changing country regulations and regional trade agreements, impact of technologies on new business models and process changes, cross-border M&A, and emerging marketing companies expanding regionally, etc.\nCompanies will have to continuously evaluate their strategies and adapt their supply chains to deal with these changes.
