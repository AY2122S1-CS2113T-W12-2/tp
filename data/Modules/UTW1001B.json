{"moduleCode":"UTW1001B","title":"What is a nation? Texts, images and national identity","description":"National identity is an integral part of who we are. Yet, it remains a highly disputed concept. This course will problematize key theoretical debates by exploring Singapore’s national identity and examining how Singapore and regional countries have been shaped by interaction with colonialism and beyond. Drawing on a Multimodal Discourse Analysis (MDA), which allows us to analyse image and text interactions, we explore how national icons are created in public media and ask the question of how national identity still remains a powerful and emotional entity that rallies or divides people of different ethnicities, religious, cultural and socio-economic backgrounds.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying English Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic Purposes modules","preclusion":"Students who have already read a IEM1201%, UTW1001% and ES1501% module.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"3","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"3","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"RC4-SR6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"2","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"CAPT-SR4","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"2","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"CAPT-SR4","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"RC4-SR6","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15}]}]}
