{"moduleCode":"CN3101A","title":"Chemical Engineering Process Lab","description":"Students will learn how to perform laboratory-scale\nexperiments in a small team. This practical module\nstrengthens their technical writing and oral presentation,\nand problem-solving skills. Experiments in this module are\nrelated to chemical engineering thermodynamics, fluid\nmechanics, heat and mass transfer, reaction engineering,\nprocess dynamics and control, mass transfer and\nseparation processes. Moreover, students will learn how to\nuse safety equipment to handle hazardous waste following\nsafety protocols. They will also learn\nassembly/disassembly of equipment, fault diagnosis,\noperation of thermocouples and flow meters, instrumental\nanalysis, data logging and processing, operation of process\nplant items, error analysis and data validation.\n(","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CN2121 - Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics\nCN2122A - Fluid Mechanics\nCN2116 - Chemical Kinetics \u0026 Reactor Design\nCN2125 - Heat and Mass Transfer\nCN3124A - Fluid-Particle Systems","preclusion":"CN3101 - Chemical Engineering Process Lab I\nCN3102 - Chemical Engineering Process Lab II","corequisite":"CN3121 - Process Dynamics and Control, CN3132 - Separation Processes","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"EW2-04-02","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":60},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"EW2-04-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":60},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"EW2-04-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":60}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":50},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":50}]}]}
