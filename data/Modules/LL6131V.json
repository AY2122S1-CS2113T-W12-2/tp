{"moduleCode":"LL6131V","title":"Law, Governance \u0026 Development in Asia","description":"In the wake of Asia\u0027s striking economic progress issues of law and governance are now seen as critical for the developing, developed and post-conflict states of Asia. Legal reforms are embracing constitutional, representative government, good governance and accountability, and human rights, based on the rule of law. How and on what principles should Asian states build these new legal orders? Can they sustain economic progress and satisfy the demands for the control of corruption and abuses of powers, and the creation of new forms of accountability? This course examines on a broad comparative canvas the nature, fate and prospects for law and governance in developing democracies in Asia, using case studies drawn especially from SE Asian states. Coverage of the issues will be both theoretical, as we ask questions about the evolving nature of \u0027law and development\u0027; and practical, as ask questions about the implementation of law and development projects across Asia.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"Students who are taking or have taken LL6131.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
