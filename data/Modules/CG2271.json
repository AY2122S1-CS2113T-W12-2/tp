{"moduleCode":"CG2271","title":"Real-Time Operating Systems","description":"Real-time systems must respond quickly to inputs from the environment in order to work effectively and safely, and realtime operating systems (RTOS) are a critical part of such systems. In this course the student is exposed to basic RTOS concepts like tasks, scheduling algorithms, RTOS customisation and concurrent real-time programming. By the end of this course a student will not only understand how an RTOS is built, but will also gain practical hands-on experience in customising RTOSs and in writing real-time programs.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computing and Engineering Programme","faculty":"Multi Disciplinary Programme","prerequisite":"(CS1020 or its equivalent) or (CS2040 or its equivalent)","preclusion":"CS2106 Introduction to Operating Systems","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Dec 2, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"02","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":60},{"classNo":"01","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":60},{"classNo":"03","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1100,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"02","startTime":800,"endTime":900,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1100,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]},{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 28, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"02","startTime":1700,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":24},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1600,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":24},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"03","startTime":1500,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":24},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":23},{"classNo":"02","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E4A-04-08","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":23}]}]}
