{"moduleCode":"FMA1203Q","title":"FS: Contemplating Theme Parks","description":"This freshman seminar offers a sociological and historic look at the theme park, a type of leisure increasingly ubiquitous in the contemporary environment. Through the examination of various theme parks, and studies that critically assess their meanings and roles in contemporary society, students will be challenged to think critically about aspects of leisure and popular culture that shape our world views. They will also be challenged to think about questions such as “What is culture?”; “What is authentic culture?”; and “How does culture change and adapt across the globe in this age of mobility?”.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"Other Freshman Seminar modules","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
