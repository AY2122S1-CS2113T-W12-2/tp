{"moduleCode":"ME3241","title":"Microprocessor Applications","description":"In this module, students are taught how the microprocessor/microcomputer is applied as the brain in an intelligent mechatronic system. Major topics include: Basic operations of the microprocessor; Introductory assembly language programming; High-level language programming; Basic interfacing with external devices and working with real-time devices. Upon successful completion, students will be able to have the confidence to design and implement smart products and systems, including intelligent robotic devices and machines, and intelligent measurement systems. This is a technical elective with the main target audience being mechanical engineering students in their third year of study. Examples of application, tailored specifically for mechanical engineers, are used to illustrate the principles.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 29, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2200,"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}]}]}
