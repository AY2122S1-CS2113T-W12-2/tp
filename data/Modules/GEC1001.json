{"moduleCode":"GEC1001","title":"Chinese Music, Language and Literature (in English)","description":"This course explores the complex relationships underlying Chinese music, language and literature. It focuses on Chinese music from the perspective of popular music produced in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. These four economies have developed different strands of popular music in Mandarin and various Chinese dialects, due to different linguistic and ideological environments. Students will learn how Chinese popular music draws upon the aesthetics of Chinese literature and traditional Chinese music, and how the music has hybridised influences from foreign musical genres, thus expressing different versions of “Chineseness”.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GEK1053, GEH1006","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D3","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS4-0115","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":8},{"classNo":"D5","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS4-0114","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":8},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"UT-AUD2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":64},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS4-0115","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":8},{"classNo":"D6","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS4-0114","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":8},{"classNo":"D4","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS4-0115","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":8},{"classNo":"D8","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS4-0115","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":8},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS1-0213","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":8},{"classNo":"D7","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS4-0115","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":8}]}]}
