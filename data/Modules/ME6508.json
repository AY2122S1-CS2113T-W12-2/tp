{"moduleCode":"ME6508","title":"Atomistic Simulations of Materials","description":"This module teaches methods and tools for simulations of material properties without experimental input (e.g. ab initio based). The topics include: (1) Elements of solid state theory; (2) Introduction to  the electronic structure theory, Density Functional Theory and software; (3) Molecular dynamics simulations, their types and uses to compute dynamics as well as static properties.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
