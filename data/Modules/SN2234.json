Topics covered include women\u0027s position in the family and the kin-group, the market, social and political institutions, violence and trafficking, feminist critiques, activism and resistance, cinematic and literary expressions. The module would be of general interest to all students concerned about women\u0027s position and gender, as well those interested in South Asia.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"LT14","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS5-0202","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS5-0202","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
