{"moduleCode":"TIE2100","title":"Probability Models with Applications","description":"The module builds upon the foundation in ST2131/TS2120/IE2120E and stresses on applications of stochastic modeling.\nTopics include: Review of exponential distribution; Conditional probability and conditional expectation; Discrete time\nMarkov chains; Poisson process; Basic queuing models and continuous time Markov chains and Renewal theory. The\nemphasis of this course will be on model formulation and probabilistic analysis. Students will eventually be conversant\nwith the properties of these models and appreciate their roles in engineering applications.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SCALE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","preclusion":"DSC3215, IE2100E","corequisite":"ST2131/TS2120/IE2120E/TIE2120","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 27, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":70},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2030,"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":70}]}]}
