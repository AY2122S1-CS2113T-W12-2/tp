{"moduleCode":"CM5223","title":"Topics in Supramolecular Chemistry","description":"Supramolecular Chemistry is a rapidly developing field of research that involves the use of non-covalent interactions to form host-guest ensembles, to build geometrically specific shapes, and to assemble molecules into stable well-defined structures. Emphasizing on the roles of non-covalent interactions, designing principles, synthetic strategies and physical methods, this course will introduce students to the frontier fields of Supramolecular Chemistry that promises exciting applications in various areas. Students will be guided/inspired to understand the properties and importance of intermolecular interactions and their translation to functions in chemistry as well in bio-, nano- and materials science.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"By permission","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2200,"venue":"LT29","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}]}]}
