{"moduleCode":"UTW1001D","title":"Self, Society, and the Digital Tsunami era","description":"Cyberbullying, cyber-racism, online falsehoods. These are some of the phenomena that can be observed online. In an era of overwhelmingly diverse viewpoints within social media platforms, how has digital communication shaped and changed the way we communicate and respond to each other as human beings?
