{"moduleCode":"PH2207","title":"Hume and Kant","description":"Two major philosophers are studied in this module: David Hume, in the first half, and Immanuel Kant, in the second. We will try to determine what each philosopher\u0027s fundamental approach to philosophy consists in, and how it gives rise to his views on the nature of causation, the external world, the self, and the limits of knowledge. As Kant\u0027s first Critique was a response to Hume\u0027s philosophical scepticism, we will pay close attention to his diagnoses of Hume\u0027s difficulties and his proposed solutions.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"W3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":16},{"classNo":"W2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":17},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":17},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
