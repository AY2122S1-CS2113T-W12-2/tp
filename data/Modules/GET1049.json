{"moduleCode":"GET1049","title":"Thinking Strategically","description":"In our interactions with family, friends, and strangers, each of us have own goals, which may or may not coincide with the other party’s goals. Should I compete or cooperate? Should I move first or last? Should I issue a threat or a promise? This module introduces concepts and insights from game theory. We will apply strategic thinking to examples drawn from business, politics, evolutionary biology, sports, and everyday social interactions. We will learn by playing games in the classroom, analyzing movie scenes, and dissecting current events.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
