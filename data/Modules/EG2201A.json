{"moduleCode":"EG2201A","title":"User-Centred Collaborative Design","description":"This is a design module which focuses on user needs, bringing together their perspectives along with those of various stakeholders, to deliver solutions in a collaborative manner. The key element in this module is the process that students go through to frame design problems, define a hypothesis for testing, and to build low fidelity prototypes for feedback and validation. Through an open-ended team project, students work collaboratively in a studio environment to create a shared understanding of the problem statement. Students go on to develop concept solutions which can be prototyped and tested.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E2A-02-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E2A-03-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E2A-03-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E2A-04-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"ENG-AUD","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E2A-04-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E2A-03-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E2A-02-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E2A-03-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}]}]}
