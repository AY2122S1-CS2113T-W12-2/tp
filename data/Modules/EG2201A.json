{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This is a design module which focuses on user needs, bringing together their perspectives along with those of various stakeholders, to deliver solutions in a collaborative manner. The key element in this module is the process that students go through to frame design problems, define a hypothesis for testing, and to build low fidelity prototypes for feedback and validation. Through an open-ended team project, students work collaboratively in a studio environment to create a shared understanding of the problem statement. Students go on to develop concept solutions which can be prototyped and tested.","title":"User-Centred Collaborative Design","department":"FoE Dean's Office","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2.5,0,4,3.5,0],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EG2201A","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2A-02-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2A-03-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2A-03-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2A-04-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ENG-AUD","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2A-03-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2A-04-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2A-02-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E2A-03-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
