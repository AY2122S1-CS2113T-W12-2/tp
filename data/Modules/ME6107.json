{"moduleCode":"ME6107","title":"Plasticity and Inelastic Deformation","description":"This class will cover the fundamental and physical basis of plastic/inelastic deformation and other dissipative processes. Here we will develop continuum-based isotropic plasticity and crystal-plasticity-type constitutive equations through a rigorous thermodynamic approach. The first part of the course will be devoted to the teaching of continuum mechanics/balance laws/thermodynamics, the second part will focus on the development of constitutive equations for plasticity and the third part will concentrate on the application of plasticity theory through numerical techniques.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"ME6105: Continuum mechanics (Pre-requisite)","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
