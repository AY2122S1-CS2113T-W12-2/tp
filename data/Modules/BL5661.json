{"moduleCode":"BL5661","title":"Urban Agriculture and Crop Biotechnology","description":"The module will cover the key challenges to sustainable food production arising from climate change. The need for indoor agriculture will be examined along with the cutting-edge precision agricultural technologies associated with this form of urban agriculture. The importance of scientific research in food security will be discussed with genetic solutions, including GWAS, marker-assisted breeding, and genome editing. Furthermore, the key challenges unique to urban indoor farming such as diseases, pests, abiotic stresses will be reviewed. There will be talks by guests from local industry, along with mini projects and seminars by students to enrich their learning outcomes.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Some background in plant biology and biotechnology is desirable","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":33},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":33}]}]}
