{"moduleCode":"EL4204","title":"Pragmatics","description":"Pragmatics is the study of language in relation to context. As such, it deals broadly with the question of how communication takes place. For example, we can ask how it is possible for someone to say \u0027The door is open\u0027 and mean it as a request (\u0027Close the door\u0027). There are clearly cultural factors involved, but there also appear to be more universal principles of communication.  This advanced module provides students with the opportunity to critically examine fundamental pragmatic concepts, and their theoretical relevance in explaining communicative behavior.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in EL, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
