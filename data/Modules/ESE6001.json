{"moduleCode":"ESE6001","title":"Environmental Fate of Organic Contaminant","description":"This module examines fundamental principles that govern transformation and\nfate of organic contaminants in natural and engineered systems. Thermodynamic principles and molecular properties are used throughout the module to develop\npredictive relationships for the solubility of organic contaminants, partitioning between\nenvironmental phases, sorption to solid surfaces, and transformation processes.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Graduate student standing","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
