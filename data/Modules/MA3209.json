{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module revisits ideas in analysis from a more abstract point of view, in the settings of metric spaces\nand topological spaces. These abstract notions form the basis for much of modern mathematics, especially\nin geometry and analysis. Main topics: metric spaces, convergence, completeness, contraction mappings,\ntopological spaces, compactness, compact spaces of functions, locally compact spaces.","title":"Metric and Topological Spaces","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"MA2108 or MA2108S","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MA3209","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-12-01T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["MA2108","MA2108S"]},"fulfillRequirements":["MA5210","MA4211","MA4262","MA4266"]}
