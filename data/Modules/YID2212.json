{"moduleCode":"YID2212","title":"Data Science for the Environment","description":"Data is the new oxygen. Understanding how to use and analyse it is the most critical skill of the 21st century. Particularly for the environment, which brings together a multitude of complex systems and phenomena, we need to be equipped to derive clear signals from oceans of noise and from vast amounts of data that are being generated on a daily basis to underpin sound policy choices and scientific inquiry. This course will introduce students to analyse quantitative environmental data using R and give an overview of foundational and cutting-edge data science techniques.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","preclusion":"YSS2242 Data Science for the Environment","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
