{"moduleCode":"MS3217","title":"Political Economy, Ethnicity, Religion","description":"The development of capitalism may affect cultural communities differently, hence the necessity for studying the political economy of Malay society from pre-colonial to contemporary periods. How and why do ethno-religious identities such as being Malay and Muslim shape distinct policies and practices of economics, business and entrepreneurship? Case studies examined will include forms of ethnic-oriented economic affirmative action policy, halal and Islamic financial services industry and the corporatisation of certain Syariah activities.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Malay Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT10","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30}]}]}
