{"moduleCode":"EL3259","title":"Language as Interaction","description":"Language is not an abstract set of rules or decontextualized structure used to encode messages. It is a deeply interactional phenomenon, which finds its natural home in the way human beings, as social actors, engage with each other through the work of communication. This module introduces students to this interactional nature of language, offering the basic conceptual and analytic tools for studying language in a way that takes into account its grounding in human social interaction.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"EL2151","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
