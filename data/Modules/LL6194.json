{"moduleCode":"LL6194","title":"Partnership and LLP Law","description":"This module will examine in depth the law of partnerships. The basic framework is the same in most Commonwealth countries and based still on the UK Partnership Act of 1890. The topics to be covered in relation to general partnerships include the formation of partnerships, partnerships in the modern legal system, the relationship between partners and outsiders, the relationship of partners inter se and the dissolution of partnerships. The module will then examine the variants of limited partnerships, used mainly as investment vehicles, and limited liability partnerships. LLPs, a recent creation, are becoming increasingly popular for the professions especially. They are an amalgam of corporate and partnership concepts but are also developing their own specific legal issues which will only increase with time.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
