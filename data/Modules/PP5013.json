The\nmodule will examine the kind of analyses required, the difficulties involved, and what strategies are likely to be effective. It also examines where unethical behavior\ncomes from and how ethical behavior can be incentivized; and the link between compliance, awareness and values.","moduleCredit":1.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":830,"endTime":2000,"venue":"LKY_SR3-5","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90}]}]}
