{"moduleCode":"LL5461V","title":"Compliance and Risk Management","description":"This course examines the rules and standards that govern the subject of compliance and risk management. It starts by examining questions of governance: boards of directors, and executives. We then examine the compliance function\nthrough the lens of managers, regulators, prosecutors, whistle blowers, and gatekeepers. Next, we consider particular areas of the law: corruption, anti-money\nlaundering, and export controls. We examine case studies where compliance fails and initiatives that go beyond compliance. Finally, we consider risk management as it pertains to lawyers; topics here include the governance of risk; approaches to risk management; reputational, operational, and enterprise risk.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.\nCriminal Law","preclusion":"LL4461 / LL5461 / LL6461 / LLJ5461 Compliance and Risk\nManagement","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E-Hybrid_D","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":11}]}]}
