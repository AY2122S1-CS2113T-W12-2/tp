{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Colonialism has had far reaching social, political and economic effects. Since WWII, many colonies have gained independence. However, independence did not result in the post-colonial utopias that were envisioned in struggles for independence. Colonialism has persisted. New forms of imperialism have substituted for colonialism. Further, native elites have reproduced the colonial apparatus. What, then, does de-colonization mean in this post-colonial environment? We will study the comparative history of colonialism in its political, economic, and social dimensions and examine its diverse effects. We will examine decolonization as a historical episode and as a movement today.","title":"Colonialism and Decolonization","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[1,1,1,3,6.5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3302","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1930","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR16","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1930","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR16","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
