A student-selected USPitch Project provides a first-hand practical experience of the issues explored in earlier sections.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1800,"venue":"USP-SR1","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":20}]}]}
