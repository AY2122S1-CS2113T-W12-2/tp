{"moduleCode":"SSA1201","title":"Singapore Society","description":"In this module, we seek to reflect on some taken-for-granted understandings of “Singapore society” and to dialogue with the readings, lectures and tutorial materials. We hope you will be able to appreciate the diverse social, political, historical processes and legacies, problems and contradictions that have constructed Singapore society. Ultimately, we aim to equip you with varied viewpoints that will enable you to think critically about Singapore society, its past, its present and its future.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GES1028","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
