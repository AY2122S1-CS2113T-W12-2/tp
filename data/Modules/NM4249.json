{"moduleCode":"NM4249","title":"Media \u0026 Audiences","description":"As old media (radio, film, TV) passes through the process of digitisation, so its audience is implicated in this transformation. This module investigates the complex disruptions in national identities, media institutions and changing consumption habits by interrogating the categories of audiences, media history and media texts. In understanding the relationships between media texts, audience and society, this module endeavours to empower student participation in a dialogue about contemporary media and society issues. This module investigates the interstices of this media trajectory with emphasis on television texts and audiences.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2012 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in NM, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":45}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"AS6-0212","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
