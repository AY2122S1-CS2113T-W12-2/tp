{"moduleCode":"PP5910","title":"MIA Thesis","description":"The MIA thesis is an independent piece of writing that represents the culmination of a student’s training in International Affairs. It is an opportunity for students to investigate a significant question in international affairs— and discover the answer--through research, reflection, analysis, and writing. Another way to think about the thesis is as an exercise where students tackle an important international affairs problem and come up with an original solution.","moduleCredit":8.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":830,"venue":"","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
