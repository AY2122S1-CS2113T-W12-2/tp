{"moduleCode":"PHS1110","title":"Foundation for Medicinal and Synthetic Chemistry","description":"This module covers essential topics in medicinal and synthetic organic chemistry that serve as the foundation for understanding the principles of drug discovery and development. Functional groups and ring structures are the key features that confer physicochemical and reactivity properties to chemical and biological drug molecules. Physicochemical properties that contribute to variation in drug likeness will be dealt with in detail. Functional groups and rings that are susceptible to structural derivatisation will be discussed in terms of the reaction mechanism involved illustrating how structural modifications can create better drug likeness.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Pharmacy","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"H2 Chemistry or equivalent","preclusion":"PR1110A Foundations for Medicinal Chemistry and PR1110 Foundations for Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacy Major","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
