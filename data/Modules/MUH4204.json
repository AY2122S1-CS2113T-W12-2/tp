{"moduleCode":"MUH4204","title":"Learning and Challenging the Historical Narrative","description":"This module is an intensive survey of Western music that both prepares students for upcoming placement examinations that they may be required to sit for future postgraduate studies, and encourages them to critically assess and challenge existing historical narratives and canonic thinking. Students will review and study in detail all historical aspects associated with the creation of music, including genres, styles, historical periods, composers’ lives and works, and patrons. Students will continually consider and question the motivations behind the inclusion and exclusion of artists and artworks in the constructed stories of music.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"3rd and 4th year BMus students only","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"YSTCM-SR6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15}]}]}
