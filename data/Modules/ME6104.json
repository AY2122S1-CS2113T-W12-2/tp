{"moduleCode":"ME6104","title":"Fracture Mechanics and Applications","description":"Understanding and prevention of fracture in engineering applications require the integration of several fundamental concepts in solid mechanics and material behaviour. In this course, major topics to be covered include linear elastic and elastic-plastic fracture mechanics, energy approach to fracture, introduction to finite element analysis, interfacial fracture mechanics and its applications to thin film and multilayered structures in electronic packaging.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
