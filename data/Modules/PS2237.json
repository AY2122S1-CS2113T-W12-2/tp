{"moduleCode":"PS2237","title":"Introduction to International Relations","description":"Designed as an introductory theoretical module, it covers the basic concepts of International Relations in two halves. The first introduces the concepts of nation, state, sovereignty, non-state actors and their implications for the coexistence of nation-states, as well as a brief roundup of the instruments of conducting relations among them. The other offers a grounding in the major schools of thought on International Relations, namely realism, liberalism/pluralism and revolutionism. Additionally, there will be topics on radical perspectives such as feminism, constructivism and postmodernism. It is hoped the module will provide students with a foundation for other courses in the sub-field.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 28, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS3-0304","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"LT10","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":75},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
