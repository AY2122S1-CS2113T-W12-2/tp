{"moduleCode":"GL4883B","title":"Climate Justice","description":"Climate change represents an unprecedented challenge to our political institutions, social norms, and even our theoretical concepts. Since the effects of climate change will be felt everywhere and for hundreds of years, it creates concerns about global and intergenerational justice, both singly and in combination. This module will explore these issues, discussing the ways in which climate change impacts and responses may be normatively criticized or justified, especially in contexts where considerations of justice must be balanced or traded off. To illustrate, we will also consider the normative issues surrounding resilient and sustainable development.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GL/GL recognized non-language modules, or 28 MCs in PS with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"AS5-0202","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
