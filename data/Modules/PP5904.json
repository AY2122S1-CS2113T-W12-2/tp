{"moduleCode":"PP5904","title":"Research Methods in International Affairs","description":"This module seeks to provide a graduate-level introduction to the main methods—qualitative and quantitative—commonly used in the analysis of international affairs. What is a good question and how do we go about assessing the answers given in the field of international relations? What\nare some of the most important methods or strategies of inquiry used by students of international studies to support or demonstrate their claims? These are the main questions addressed by module. The aim is to introduce you to some of the key methods of the field, encourage you to think critically about them, and where appropriate, apply them in your research and writing.\n\nEach session will consist of three segments. It will begin with a lecture by one or both the instructors. The lecture will be followed by a question and answer period, where students are encouraged to respond to the issues raised by the lecture and readings. The third segment will be devoted to group exercises or presentations that will allow students to apply and/or critically engage the methods and methodological issues raised by the lecture/discussion.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LKY_SR2-1","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
