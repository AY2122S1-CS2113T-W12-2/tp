{"moduleCode":"MA4247","title":"Complex Analysis II","description":"This is a second course in complex analysis which aims to introduce the student to some of the beautiful main results and applications of complex analysis. The nature of the topic allows the student to learn and understand the proofs and applications of some very strong results with relatively little background, it also shows the interplay between geometry, analysis and algebra.\n\nMajor topics: Argument principle (including Rouche\u0027s Theorem), open mapping theorem, maximum modulus principle, conformal mapping and linear fractional transformations, harmonic functions, and analytic continuation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA3111 or MA3111S","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
