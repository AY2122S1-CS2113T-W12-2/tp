{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module looks at the development of twentieth century analytic philosophy through the works of some of its major exponents.  These include Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Moore, Austin and Quine.  The fundamental assumption in analytic philosophy is the idea that all philosophical problems are really problems of language and may be solved either by reformulating them in a perfect language or by a better understanding of the language that we actually speak.  One of the aims of this course is to show how certain problems in ethics, metaphysics and epistemology may be solved (or dissolved) through the careful analysis of language and meaning.","title":"Recent Philosophy","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PH3206","semesterData":[]}
