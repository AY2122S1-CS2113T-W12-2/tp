{"moduleCode":"YSS3313","title":"Environmental Impacts of China’s Investments","description":"China has invested in thousands of development projects that promise the host countries significant economic and geo-strategic advantages. Because of that, China has left a sizable ecological footprint across the developing world. This course explores the socio-environmental implications of China’s economic presence abroad, including, but not limited to, the Belt-and-Road Initiative (BRI). Has China’s “going out” strategy ushered in less environmental destruction than environmental modernisation? Should it be perceived differently to other foreign investment strategies? We explore these questions and more through various country studies, contributing to the ongoing global debate about making China’s investments more environmentally sustainable.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
