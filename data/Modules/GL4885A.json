{"moduleCode":"GL4885A","title":"International Law and World Politics","description":"This module introduces students to international law and world politics through case studies. It begins by explaining what international law is, and how it is formed, interpreted, and used to advance certain causes or respond to specific events. Cases are introduced to students in their historical, political, and social contexts so that students can grasp not only the salient legal issues in each particular case, but also the larger diplomatic controversies that were at stake in each case and their consequences for international relations today.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, or 28 MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
