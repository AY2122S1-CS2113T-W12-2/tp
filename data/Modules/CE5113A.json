{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module teaches the essential concepts and methodology for the planning, design and implementation of geotechnical ground investigation for infrastructure, underground construction, and built environment construction.\n\nThe module will be broadly divided into two parts. The first part covers various aspects of site investigation such as the planning, design, density of bore holes, sampling technology and disturbance. The second part covers various aspects of inâ€?situ and laboratory testing of soils and rocks.\n\nThe module will cover ground investigation concepts and practices according to new Eurocode EC7. \nThis module enables participants to acquire the knowledge and practical skills through the lectures, case studies and projects.","title":"Geotechnical Investigation according to EC7","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[1,0,0,0.5,3.5],"prerequisite":"Background in soil mechanics or equivalent","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"CE5113A","attributes":{"lab":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[8,9,10,12],"venue":"E3-06-09","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1300","weeks":[8,9,10],"venue":"LT2","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":[11],"venue":"LT2","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
