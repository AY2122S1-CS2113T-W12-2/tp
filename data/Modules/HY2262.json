{"moduleCode":"HY2262","title":"The Ancient World: The Roman Empire","description":"The Roman empire was one of the longest-lasting in global history. Its enduring impact can be seen, heard and felt today, from language and architecture to film and video. This module will examine Rome’s rise and fall, and ask how it successfully ruled over so many peoples for so long, in comparison with other world empires. We will consider who made up empire: emperors, ‘barbarians’, slaves and ordinary people. We will also uncover the background to early Christianity, Roman legacies inherited through European colonialism, and the numerous references to Rome in both high and popular culture today.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"1.
