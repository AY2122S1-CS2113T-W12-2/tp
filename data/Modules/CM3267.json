{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module introduces the elements of computational\nthinking and its application in chemistry, energy and the\nenvironment and food science. These elements include\nproblem formulation/abstraction, pattern recognition,\ndecomposition, and finally algorithm design. Direct\napplication of these elements will occur through\nprogramming specifically using Python on a Raspberry Pi\ncomputer. The Raspberry Pi will be programmed to make\nreal-time observations of phenomena relevant to the\nenvironment and/or food science.","title":"Computational Thinking and Programming in Chemistry","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,0,3,2,3],"prerequisite":"Either (a) OR (b) below:\n(a) CM2191 Experiments in Chemistry 2 AND\nCM2192 Experiments in Chemistry 3\nOR\n(b) FST2102B Chemistry of Food Components","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM3267","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S13-M-09","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S13-M-09","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["CM2191",{"or":["CM2192","FST2102B"]}]}}
