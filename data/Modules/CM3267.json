{"moduleCode":"CM3267","title":"Computational Thinking and Programming in Chemistry","description":"This module introduces the elements of computational\nthinking and its application in chemistry, energy and the\nenvironment and food science. These elements include\nproblem formulation/abstraction, pattern recognition,\ndecomposition, and finally algorithm design. Direct\napplication of these elements will occur through\nprogramming specifically using Python on a Raspberry Pi\ncomputer. The Raspberry Pi will be programmed to make\nreal-time observations of phenomena relevant to the\nenvironment and/or food science.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Either (a) OR (b) below:\n(a) CM2191 Experiments in Chemistry 2 AND\nCM2192 Experiments in Chemistry 3\nOR\n(b) FST2102B Chemistry of Food Components","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"S13-M-09","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1300,"venue":"S13-M-09","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50}]}]}
