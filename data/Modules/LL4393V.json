{"moduleCode":"LL4393V","title":"Liability of Corporate Groups and Networks","description":"Corporate groups are pervasive in modern, international commerce. Frequently they are structured in order to avoid or minimise liability for wrongdoing and to protect group assets. In other cases, risky physical processes are contracted out to network participants. This course examines the structures and practices of corporate groups and networks, the problems of externalisation of liability,\nand legal mechanisms for extending liability among participant entities. Extended liability regimes considered span statute law and common law. Consideration is given also to several important suggestions for development of the law in this area.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.\nLC1004 Law of Torts","corequisite":"LC2008 Company Law","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Hybrid_D","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
