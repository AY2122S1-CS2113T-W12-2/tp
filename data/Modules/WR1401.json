{"moduleCode":"WR1401","title":"Workplace Readiness","description":"This module aims to enhance students’ workplace readiness, personal and interpersonal effectiveness, inner resilience, as well as leadership qualities.  Attributes associated with team spirit and personal effectiveness are developed through camps, sustained sports activities, and career readiness workshops and seminars. Unlike the interdisciplinary and writing and communication modules which are credit-bearing modules, this module is not credit bearing.  It is however compulsory for all students to read.  The module challenges students to venture and explore beyond their comfort zone and places them in situations/contexts where their endurance and resilience are put to test.","moduleCredit":0.0,"department":"Ridge View Residential College","faculty":"Residential College","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
