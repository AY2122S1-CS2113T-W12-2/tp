We will delve deeply into each of the selected artworks, simultaneously examining  their extraordinary uniqueness and their capacity to represent an entire cultural epoch, both  aesthetically and conceptually. Along the way we \nwill ask what makes these works “masterpieces” and debate how and why they came to form the Western artistic “canon.”","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
