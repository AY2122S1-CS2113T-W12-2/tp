{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The decisions you make every day will shape your life. In an organization, the decisions you make will impact outcomes for you, your team, and cumulatively affect the trajectory of your career. This module aims to help you navigate the\npathways of decision making in organizations. We will undertake an evidence-based approach, tapping on several streams of research – including behavioral psychology and economics, error management, and intuitive judgment – to give a rigorous account of what separates good decisions\nfrom the rest. These conceptual tools will empower you to make good decisions in an uncertain world, to influence, and to lead.","title":"Leadership and Decision Making under Uncertainty","department":"Management and Organisation","faculty":"NUS Business School","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"prerequisite":"MNO1706/MNO1706X or PL3239.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MNO2705D","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ1-0205","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":70,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"0830","endTime":"1130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ1-0205","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":70,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"0830","endTime":"1130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ1-0205","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":70,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D4","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ2-0413B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":70,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["MNO1706","MNO1706X","PL3239"]}}
