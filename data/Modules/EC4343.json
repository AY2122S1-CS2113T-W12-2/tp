{"moduleCode":"EC4343","title":"International Finance II","description":"The International Monetary System is the worldwide framework that facilitates cross-border flows of financial capital to finance investment and trade. Today’s system traces its roots to the late 19th century. Before World War I, major currencies were tied to gold, implying a system of fixed exchange rates without room for independent monetary policy. Today no major currency is tied to gold, and monetary policy is independent. Employing the tools presented in International Finance I, the course discusses how the system has operated throughout time and why it changed. The discussions are embedded in the economic context of the times.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in EC modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.
