{"moduleCode":"YSS3327","title":"Emotions, Feelings, Affects","description":"This course explores how social relations feel and why. Approaching emotions as irreducibly social, it investigates where feelings come from, how they vary between social groups and across time, and the numerous ways in which they emerge from and shape social life. Exploring emotions through both theory and ethnography, the course describes how anthropologists understand emotions and the ways in which ethnography enables the diverse array of feelings to be studied empirically and cross-culturally.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
