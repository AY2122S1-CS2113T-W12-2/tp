{"moduleCode":"PC4245","title":"Particle Physics","description":"This is an introductory course on the fundamental constituents of matter and their basic interactions; important concepts and principles, recent important experiments, underlying theoretical tools and calculation techniques in elementary particles physics will be expounded. The topics covered are: basic properties of elementary particles and the standard model, relativistic kinematics; symmetries: isospin and SU(3), quark model;  parity and CP violation; Feynman diagrams and rules; quantum electrodynamics; cross sections and lifetimes: deep inelastic scattering; and introductory gauge theories and unified models. This module is mainly targeted at physics majors.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students who have passed PC3130 and PC3232","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 29, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"S12-0403","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"S12-0403","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45}]}]}
