{"moduleCode":"GEH1048","title":"Technology and Artistic Innovators","description":"How have artists driven technological development, and to what extent does technology shape artistic developments? This course explores the origins of art and technology from small metal workings and glass beads long before their use in military and agriculture, to animation shorts and how they are used to utilize the latest computer hardware and software development to make the latest animation blockbusters. We will also explore how the relationship with technology and arts changes the human relationship with the arts, such as art reproductions, and how technological advances in the arts alters our relationship with each other, like the advent of headphones and the Sony Walkman. Common homework assignments, including scholarly readings and audio and video files, form the foundation for course work and class discussions.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","preclusion":"GEM2021, MUL3202","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
