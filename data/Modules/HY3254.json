{"moduleCode":"HY3254","title":"Cold War in East Asia","description":"No one can say that the Cold War has ended yet in East Asia. But rather a number of the contemporary intra?regional tensions in East Asia stem from the Cold War era; from the tensions over the Taiwan Straits, to the temporary cease?fire status between North and South Korea, to the constitutional controversy in Japan. With a special emphasis on the international dimension, this module explores how the Cold War confrontation (1945?present) has unfolded in the historical context of East Asia over the past decades.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS4-0109","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"AS4-0109","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS1-0207","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
