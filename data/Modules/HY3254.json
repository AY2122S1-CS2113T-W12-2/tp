{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"No one can say that the Cold War has ended yet in East Asia. But rather a number of the contemporary intraâ€?regional tensions in East Asia stem from the Cold War era; from the tensions over the Taiwan Straits, to the temporary ceaseâ€?fire status between North and South Korea, to the constitutional controversy in Japan. With a special emphasis on the international dimension, this module explores how the Cold War confrontation (1945â€?present) has unfolded in the historical context of East Asia over the past decades.","title":"Cold War in East Asia","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"HY3254","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS4-0109","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS4-0109","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"AS1-0207","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-05T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
