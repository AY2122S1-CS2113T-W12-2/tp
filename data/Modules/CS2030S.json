{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"CS2030","description":"This module is a follow up to CS1010. It explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and functional programming. Through a series of integrated assignments, students will learn to develop medium-scale software programs in the order of thousands of lines of code and tens of classes using object-oriented design principles and advanced programming constructs available in the two paradigms. Topics include objects and classes, composition, association, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, abstract classes, dynamic binding, lambda expression, effect-free programming, first class functions, closures, continuations, monad, etc.","title":"Programming Methodology II","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,1,2,3,2],"prerequisite":"CS1010 or its equivalent","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS2030S","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"16B","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-B109","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"10H","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-0114","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":10,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"12B","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-B109","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"16A","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-B112","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Recitation","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"02","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Recitation","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"03","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Recitation","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"04","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Recitation","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"05","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Recitation","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"06","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Recitation","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"10A","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-B112","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"14A","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-B112","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":180,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"10B","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-B109","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"12A","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-B112","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"14B","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-B109","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"08","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":10,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-11-25T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":600,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2022-04-28T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"CS1010"}
