From social media to public relations campaigns, from game design to website layout, from business decisionâ€?making to news, from democratic participation to interactive art â€“ the ability to understand and make creative use of computational media is of fundamental importance. This module is a handsâ€?on introduction to essential concepts in computational media including internet architecture, mediated communication, interactive systems, animation, visualization, big data, and creative design. JavaScript and other common technologies that power the web are introduced to empower nonâ€?programmers to explore these concepts independently.","title":"Computational Media Literacy","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[3,2,0,4,1],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"NM2207","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":true,"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT9","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT10","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"fulfillRequirements":["CS3240"]}
