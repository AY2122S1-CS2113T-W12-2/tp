{"moduleCode":"MA2401","title":"Introductory Mathematics with R","description":"This module presents a gentle introduction to programming using the statistical software R and uses R to introduce essential concepts in calculus, linear algebra and probability for data analytics. Topics include: getting started with R; functions and graphing, derivatives, integrals, dynamics; vectors and matrices, solving systems of linear equations, projections, eigenvalues and eigenvectors; probability, conditional probability and Bayes’ Theorem, random variables and their properties, useful discrete, continuous and bivariate/multivariate distributions, the Central Limit Theorem. Strong emphasis is placed on computation and simulation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Pass in GCE ‘O’ Level Additional Mathematics or GCE ‘AO’ Level or H1 Mathematics","preclusion":"Mathematics majors, Quantitative Finance majors, Data Science and Analytics majors, Statistics majors, Mathematics second majors, Quantitative Finance second majors, Data Analytics second majors, Statistics second majors, School of Computing students, Faculty of Engineering students, all MA-coded modules (except MA1301/MA1301X), ST2131, ST2334, ST3236, ST4238","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 25, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"LT27","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":400},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"LT27","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":400},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1300,"venue":"S17-0404","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}]}]}
