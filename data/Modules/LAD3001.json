{"moduleCode":"LAD3001","title":"Design 5","description":"This course continues to develop a level of competence in design skills and critical thinking through a design task that increases the scale and complexity of considerations. Focusing on a high-dense urban context, students will be asked to retrofit existing neighbourhood landscapes in residential blocks/towns. The emphasis will be liveability and sustainability and will involve the integration of required spaces/facilities and innovative landscape elements within a high-dense urban context. They will work across a range of representational modes including technical diagrams and three dimensional physical/digital modelling to develop relative certainty in the functional and aesthetic aspects of their design proposal.","moduleCredit":8.0,"department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","prerequisite":"Min C grade for LAD2001 Design 3 and LAD2002 Design 4","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1800,"venue":"SDE1-CL3","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20}]}]}
