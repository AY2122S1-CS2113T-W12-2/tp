{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course continues to develop a level of competence in design skills and critical thinking through a design task that increases the scale and complexity of considerations. Focusing on a high-dense urban context, students will be asked to retrofit existing neighbourhood landscapes in residential blocks/towns. The emphasis will be liveability and sustainability and will involve the integration of required spaces/facilities and innovative landscape elements within a high-dense urban context. They will work across a range of representational modes including technical diagrams and three dimensional physical/digital modelling to develop relative certainty in the functional and aesthetic aspects of their design proposal.","title":"Design 5","department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","workload":[1,2,0,5,12],"prerequisite":"Min C grade for LAD2001 Design 3 and LAD2002 Design 4","moduleCredit":"8","moduleCode":"LAD3001","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,11,11,12,12,13,13],"venue":"SDE1-CL3","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"fulfillRequirements":["LAD3005"]}
