{"moduleCode":"PC1431","title":"Physics IE","description":"The module is designed to provide a clear and logical introduction to the concepts and principles of mechanics and thermodynamics, with illustrations based on applications to the real world. Topics covered include motion in one dimension; curvilinear motion; circular motion; relative motion; Newton\u0027s laws; friction; work and energy; conservative forces, conservation of energy; linear momentum and conservation, collisions; rotational kinematics; moment of inertia and torque; rotational dynamics; conservation of angular momentum; gravitational force, field and potential energy; planetary motion; temperature and the zeroth law, temperature scales; thermal expansion of solids and liquids; heat and internal energy, specific heat capacities, enthalpy and latent heat, work for ideal gases, first law of thermodynamics; equipartition of energy, mean free path; entropy and the second law, heat engines; entropy changes for reversible and irreversible processes. The module is targeted essentially at Engineering students.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students from FOE (i.e. Civil Eng, Environmental Eng, Common Engineering, Mechanical Eng, Bioengineering, Industrial \u0026 Systems Eng and Material Science \u0026 Eng) with ‘A’ level or H2 pass in Physics; or \u0027A\u0027 level or H2 pass in Physics; or PC1221/PC1221FC/PC1221X \u0026 PC1222/PC1222X; or PC1201","preclusion":"Students majoring in Physics or students who have passed in PC1141 or PC1142 or PC1433 or PC1431FC or PC1431X are not allowed to take this module.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"03","startTime":1200,"endTime":1300,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"02","startTime":1500,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"07","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"S11-0302","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":14},{"classNo":"03","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"S11-0302","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":14},{"classNo":"05","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"S11-0302","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":14},{"classNo":"04","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"S11-0302","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":14},{"classNo":"06","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"S11-0302","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":14},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"S11-0302","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":14},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1300,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"08","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"S11-0302","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":14},{"classNo":"02","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"S11-0302","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":14}]},{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 4, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"LT28","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":95},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"LT20","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":95}]}]}
