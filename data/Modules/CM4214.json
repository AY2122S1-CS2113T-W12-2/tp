{"moduleCode":"CM4214","title":"Structural Methods in Inorganic Chem","description":"This module covers the commonly used methods to determine the structure of inorganic and organometallic compounds including symmetry operators, point groups and irreducible representations; Raman or IR active vibrational modes; the\nprinciples and theories of single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction techniques; assessment of quality of published crystal structures; NMR as a powerful diagnostic tool to determine structures and fluxional mechanisms. High resolution mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectroscopy may be introduced.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM3211 or CM3212","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
