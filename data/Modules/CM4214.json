{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module covers the commonly used methods to determine the structure of inorganic and organometallic compounds including symmetry operators, point groups and irreducible representations; Raman or IR active vibrational modes; the\nprinciples and theories of single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction techniques; assessment of quality of published crystal structures; NMR as a powerful diagnostic tool to determine structures and fluxional mechanisms. High resolution mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectroscopy may be introduced.","title":"Structural Methods in Inorganic Chem","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,3,3],"prerequisite":"CM3211 or CM3212","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM4214","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["CM3211","CM3212"]},"fulfillRequirements":["CM5212"]}
