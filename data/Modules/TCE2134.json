{"moduleCode":"TCE2134","title":"Hydraulics","description":"This course introduces the student to basic concepts of fluid\nmechanics and hydraulics. Starting with fluid properties and\nfluid statics, the student would understand how these\nconcepts are used for the calculation of hydrostatic forces\nand the stability of floating bodies. The student is\nintroduced to the concepts of fluid flow, ideal and real fluids\nand their limitations, laminar and turbulent flows, the\nconcept of the boundary layer and flow resistance, the\nconcept of flow separation and the wake, frictional and form\ndrag and lift on immersed bodies. Dimensional analysis and\nthe concept of similitude will help reinforce the fundamental\nconsiderations essential for experiments with fluid\nphenomena. By the end of the course, the student should\nunderstand the concepts of conservation of mass,\nmomentum and energy and how these can be applied to\nflow measuring devices, to the estimation of frictional losses\nfor flows in pipelines, to pumping systems and other\nengineering applications.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SCALE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"EG1109FC/EG1109/CE1109X or equivalent","preclusion":"CE2134","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 29, 2022, 2:30:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2030,"venue":"UT-AUD1","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"UT-AUD1","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":60}]}]}
