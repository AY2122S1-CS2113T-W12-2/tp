{"moduleCode":"YSS3308","title":"Boulevards, Arcades and Sewers: Paris 1830-1870","description":"The Paris of the mid-nineteenth century was a defining stage in the unfolding of modernity. The various improvement plans completed under the auspices of public works commissioner, Baron Haussmann, established a range of tools fundamental to the modernization of cities: infrastructures, knowledges, institutions. The transformations the city underwent had an enduring effect on the experience and habits of modern urban life. Focusing on the period from 1830 to 1870, this module considers both the preconditions and the effects of the rationalization of urban space that took place in Second Empire Paris. Immersing themselves in a range of evidentiary fields – from art, to literature, to photography and political discourse – students learn about the lineaments of urban modernity.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
