By venturing out to investigate why people travel, how they travel, and what travellers obtain from their experiences, one will discover that travel is not merely a transitory  experience or a recreational endeavour. It defines people’s identities, shapes their interactions, and\ninfluences the economy, politics, and other social systems.
