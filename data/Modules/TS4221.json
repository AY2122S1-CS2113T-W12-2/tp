{"moduleCode":"TS4221","title":"Performance Research","description":"Doing performance can teach us things that watching it cannot. This module uses performance practice as a research methodology to investigate otherwise inaccessible questions of creativity, embodiment, and performance processes. The three main components of the module include: defining a research question, designing and conducting experiments/observations, presenting the outcomes. Students will conceptualize and execute their own research project, in a relationship of collaborative research with artists. The nature of the project determines the resulting presentation: multi-media talk, lecture-demonstration, or short performance or workshop. The module will also focus on case studies from a range of cultural and stylistic sources.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"AS5-0205","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25}]}]}
