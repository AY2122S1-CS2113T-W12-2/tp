{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"CS4230","description":"The aim of this module is to study the various measures of difficulty of problem solving in computing, and to introduce some techniques in theoretical computer science such as non-determinism, digitalisation, simulation, padding, reduction, randomisation and interaction. Topics covered include: space and time complexity - the classes P, NP, co-NP, PSPACE, EXP, etc.; tape compression; linear speedup; polynomial reduction; Cook's theorem; Savitch's theorem; translation lemma; Gap theorem; NP-completeness and NP-hard problems; probabilistic complexity classes; approximation algorithms; and interactive protocols.","title":"Computational Complexity","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"CS4232 Theory of Computation","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS5230","attributes":{"lab":true,"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":110,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2022-05-06T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"CS4232"}
