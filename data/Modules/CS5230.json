{"moduleCode":"CS5230","title":"Computational Complexity","description":"The aim of this module is to study the various measures of difficulty of problem solving in computing, and to introduce some techniques in theoretical computer science such as non-determinism, digitalisation, simulation, padding, reduction, randomisation and interaction. Topics covered include: space and time complexity - the classes P, NP, co-NP, PSPACE, EXP, etc.; tape compression; linear speedup; polynomial reduction; Cook\u0027s theorem; Savitch\u0027s theorem; translation lemma; Gap theorem; NP-completeness and NP-hard problems; probabilistic complexity classes; approximation algorithms; and interactive protocols.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS4232 Theory of Computation","preclusion":"CS4230","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 6, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2030,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":110}]}]}
