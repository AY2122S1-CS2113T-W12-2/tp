{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"GET1024","description":"This module aims to equip students with the essential knowledge to make intelligent assessments on the potential risks and uses of radiation in our modern society. After introducing the physics behind various forms of radiation, we will look at how these radiations are used in medical diagnosis and treatment and other applications. Some controversial issues in these applications will be raised and debated. The health effects of high and low levels of radiation will be presented based on scientific evidence thus dispelling some of the negative misconceptions of radiation and irrational fear of it. The social and political dynamics in electricity generation through nuclear power plants in various countries will also be discussed.","title":"Radiation-Scientific Understanding and Public Perception","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,0.5,0.5,1.5,4.5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEC1036","attributes":{"mpes2":true,"su":true},"aliases":["GET1024"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT33","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT33","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
