{"moduleCode":"HY3261","title":"Historicizing Science, Technology and Society","description":"This module surveys the history and philosophy underpinning science, technology and society. In part 1 we will examine the history of the Scientific Revolution and its historiographical significance. With this context in mind, part 2 shifts focus to the impact of science and technology on modern societies, keeping in mind the broader historical circumstances that have shaped these forces. Students will encounter historical and contemporary case studies from regions including Europe, the United States and Asia. Themes and topics will allow for an enhanced understanding of the intersections that science and technology have with race, gender, imperialism and the environment.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
