{"moduleCode":"CE6077C","title":"Numerical Methods and Applications to Civil Engineering Mechanics","description":"This course extends the fundamental concepts in CE6077A and combines it with complementary numerical methods, for solving problems in engineering mechanics, e.g. wave propagation in solids, stability and dynamics of structural / engineering systems.\n\nThe focus will be to understand the limitations of different numerical schemes for the various problems in mechanics. The module will enable students to select the suitable numerical strategy, develop the relevant numerical framework and to\nimplement them.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CE2407 or equivalent","preclusion":"CE5311, CE5377/CE6077, CE6003","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E4-04-02","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
