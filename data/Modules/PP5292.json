{"moduleCode":"PP5292","title":"The EU, ASEAN and Regional Integration","description":"Using the European Union and ASEAN as examples, we will study the opportunities and challenges posed by regional (economic) integration. In particular, we examine the EU’s institutional setup, its core policies, and its place on the international stage as the largest common market in the world. We will compare and contrast the EU\u0027s experience with that of ASEAN to see what conclusions can be drawn on the prospects of regional integration.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
