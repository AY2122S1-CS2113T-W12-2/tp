An emphasis is placed on the role of remedies within the broader structure of private law, and the question of what, if anything, remedies tell us about the substantive law.\n\nThe course ranges across a variety of substantive private law fields, examining remedies arising from contracts, torts, equity, and other sources of obligations. It will introduce students to basic organising private law concepts such as rights, duties, wrongs, loss, and gain, and the various remedial goals of compensation, vindication, disgorgement, restitution, and punishment.","title":"Remedies","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"LL5268V","aliases":["LL4268V","LL6268V"],"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Hybrid_D","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
