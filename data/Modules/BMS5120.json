{"moduleCode":"BMS5120","title":"Innovation and Strategies for Emerging Markets","description":"This module is divided into two parts. The goal of the first half is to help students develop an intuitive understanding of strategy as a process which will be useful in the second half of the module when we apply this process directly in the context of innovations for emerging markets. While we cover a set of strategic tools, the emphasis is not on filling in frameworks and applying standard recipes. On the contrary, students will be expected to challenge recipes, question received wisdom, and exhibit an understanding of how to apply the frameworks to solve strategic obstacles.\nWhile the cases and the examples used in the module are primarily based on Asia, the lessons from this module apply more generally to emerging markets across Africa and Latin America. Rather than looking for one “right” answer, this module encourages debates and discussions. In some ways, this module is a cross between an executive education module on strategy formulation and implementation and a module on Asian business. Our goal is to help students develop the strategic intuition and tools they need to succeed in these emerging battlegrounds for tomorrow.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"02","startTime":1830,"endTime":2130,"venue":"BIZ1-0307","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"BIZ1-0204","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40}]}]}
