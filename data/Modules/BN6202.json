{"moduleCode":"BN6202","title":"Advanced Human Motion Biomechanics","description":"This module introduces students to advanced concepts of human motion biomechanics and their applications in clinicial settings, particularly rehabilitation and orthopaedics. At the end of this course, students are expected to be able to analyse and explain clinical biomechanics data, and to execute a human motion biomechanics research study from experimental design to data collection and analysis, and finally manuscript preparation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Graduate student standing","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
