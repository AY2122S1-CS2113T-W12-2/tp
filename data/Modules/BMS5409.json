Numerous conceptual and theoretical frameworks will be introduced to help the students explore and internalize the various complex organizational structures and processes facing all managers operating in today’s turbulent global environment. Both theoretical and applied approaches will be adopted. Given that Asia is and will be the driver of global economic growth for the next few decades, we will adopt an Asian perspective as we explore ongoing global management and organizational issues.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","preclusion":"BMS5403, MNO3334, MNO3716","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
