{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"GEC1025","description":"Oceans cover most of the globe. Yet once we venture from  the   shore, our  understanding  of  the  marine environment  is  necessarily  mediated  by  technology, from  the  plumb  line  used  by  sailors  for  millennia  to measure  the  waterâ€™s  depth,  to  the  latest  satellite imaging  tracking  ocean  currents  in  real  time.  This module    examines    how  different  â€œmachines,â€?  or technologies  have  produced  understandings  of  the ocean across history, and places these technologies in their social, cultural, economic, and political contexts. The   result   is   to   reveal   the   complex   and   evolving interconnections that link technology, and society and our understanding of the natural world.","title":"The Life Aquatic: Machines and the Making of the Ocean","department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEH1068","attributes":{"mpes2":true,"su":true},"aliases":["GEC1025"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS3-0309","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS4-0119","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS4-0328","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS2-0413","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":10,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"]}]}
