{"moduleCode":"YHU3210F","title":"Proseminar in Literary Studies","description":"What is literary studies, how did it come about as a field of study, and how can individuals like you and me engage with it, today? This pro-seminar introduces literature majors to key works of literary and critical theory, and their historical contexts. In order to recuse “theory” from its overwrought, misunderstood opposition to something perceived as more pristine and dynamic like literature “itself,” we will focus on thinkers concerned with the social acts of reading and writing, and a broader variety of what are considered as “texts.”","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2 or permission of the instructor.","preclusion":"Previous iterations of the YHU3210 Proseminar in Literary Studies","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"Y-BlackBox","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
