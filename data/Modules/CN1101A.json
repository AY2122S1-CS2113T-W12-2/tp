{"moduleCode":"CN1101A","title":"Chemical Engineering Principles and Practice I","description":"This  module provides an experiential   exposure   to chemical  engineering concepts through  a  series  of hands-on experimental laboratories. Simple yet visually engaging demonstrations  will  bring  these  concepts  to life, and act as a preview and bridge to the core modules in the undergraduate curriculum, while highlighting their practical relevance. The students will prepare for each session   by compulsory   pre-laboratory readings   on theoretical  background  and  laboratory  procedures.  In the laboratory, they will learn to carry out measurement, data  collection,  analysis,  modelling, interpretation  and presentation.  The  laboratory  sessions  will  be  blended with  real  engineering applications  of  industrial  and societal relevance to Singapore.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"CN1101","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"8","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EW2-04-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":60},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EW2-04-02","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":60},{"classNo":"2","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EW2-04-02","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":60},{"classNo":"3","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EW2-04-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":60},{"classNo":"4","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EW2-04-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":60},{"classNo":"5","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EW2-04-02","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":60},{"classNo":"6","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EW2-04-02","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":60},{"classNo":"7","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EW2-04-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":60},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":300}]}]}
