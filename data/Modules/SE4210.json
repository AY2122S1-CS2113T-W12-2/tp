{"moduleCode":"SE4210","title":"Ancient Kingdoms of Southeast Asia","description":"Historical sources (writing) and archaeology (material culture) give very different perspectives on the development of civilisations. This module follows the development of classical civilisations in Southeast Asia from the first to the 16th centuries A.D. Data from archaeological excavations are utilised to create a picture of the achievements of early historic peoples of the region in such areas as the formation of kingdoms and cities; trade; architecture; and warfare. Relations with China and India are also analysed.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SE or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SE, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS3-0306","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25}]}]}
