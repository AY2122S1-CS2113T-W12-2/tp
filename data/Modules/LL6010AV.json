{"moduleCode":"LL6010AV","title":"Topics in the Civil Law Tradition (A): EU Harmonisation","description":"This module examines advanced topics in the civil law tradition using a\ncomparative approach, examining in particular the similiarities and differences between the civil law and the common law (and possibly other traditions) in approaching specific legal problems. The precise topics covered and examples used will vary depending on the instructor teaching the module in a given year, but the topics typically discussed would include the methodological differences between civil and common law (use of legislation and codes, use of case law / jurisprudence, use of doctrine), the differences in policies and values, as well whether we should seek convergence and unification or respect for the mentalité and culture of each legal tradition through harmonization.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent","preclusion":"Students who are taking or have taken LL6010A","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
