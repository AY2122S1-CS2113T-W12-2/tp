{"moduleCode":"PS3251","title":"International Organisations","description":"In this module, students will study the international organisations that constitute a crucial part of the global institutional architecture. Based on an understanding of the literature on international relations and organisations, the module will seek to address a set of critical questions: Why are international organisations created? What are their objectives, and how are these objectives achieved? What effects do international organisations have on the practices of international relations? Through the consideration of these questions, students will gain empirical and theoretical insights into global governance and international relations indispensable to any student of Political Science and International Relations.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"PS1101E","preclusion":"EU3228","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
