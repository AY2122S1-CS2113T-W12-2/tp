{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"GE2220 Terrestrial and Coastal Environments","description":"Earth's geosphere – the ground beneath our feet – may seem constant and relatively unchanging, but nothing could be further from the truth. This module examines the main processes that combine to influence the development of Earth’s surface and the formation of and changes to landscapes.  The origins and development of landforms, particularly in the humid tropics, is explored, as are the characteristics, functioning, dynamics and interactions within and between major associated ecosystems. Human-induced landform and ecosystem modifications are also considered.  The knowledge obtained in this module is applicable to broader environmental management issues.","title":"Earth Surface Processes, Landforms and Ecosystems","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,0,2,2,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GE3256","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-ELAB","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":55,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-ELAB","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":55,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT12","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-ELAB","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":55,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-04-30T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
