This module  introduces  students  to  the  scholarly  study  of  ghosts  and  spirits,  and  the  specialists  and  practitioners  involved  with  these  forces.  These  include  shamanism,  spirit  possession,  witchcraft  and  sorcery,  and  other  supernatural  entities  such  as  zombies,  vampires  and  werewolves,  and  how  these  intersect  with  issues  of  class,  gender,  sexuality,  ethnicity,  citizenship,  popular  culture, modernity and social change.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GEH1062","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":6},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":5},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":6},{"classNo":"D3","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":6},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":6},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":5},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":6}]}]}
