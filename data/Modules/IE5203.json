{"moduleCode":"IE5203","title":"Decision Analysis","description":"This module teaches the necessary analytical knowledge and practical skills for improving decision-making processes in engineering and business environments. This is achieved by providing a paradigm based on normative decision theory and a set of prescriptive tools and computational techniques using state-of-the art software with which a stake holder can systematically analyze a complex and uncertain decision situation leading to clarity of action. Topics from utility theory and influence diagrams modeling to multi-attribute utility theory and analytic hierarchy process are covered.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"IE4243 Decision Modeling \u0026 Risk Analysis","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 22, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":135}]}]}
