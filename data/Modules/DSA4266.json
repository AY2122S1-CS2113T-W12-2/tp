{"moduleCode":"DSA4266","title":"Sense-making Case Analysis: Science and Technology","description":"The practice of data science involves sense-making, the ability to formulate problems or hypotheses in real-world situations. Only when algorithms and technology are applied to meaningful problems or hypotheses can useful information be extracted from data for making decisions. This module is conducted as a series of hackathons: data scientists from partnering organisations in the science and technology sector provide the real-world situations and data which will enable students to gain practical experience in (i) formulating problems, (ii) solving them by applying, or developing and implementing, appropriate data-analytic tools and techniques, and (iii) communicating findings and insights gained clearly.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CS3244 Machine Learning and DSA3101 Data Science in Practice, or by permission","preclusion":"DSA4266A and DSA4266B","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2200,"venue":"LT31","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]}]}
