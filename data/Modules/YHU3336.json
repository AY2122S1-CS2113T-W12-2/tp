{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"It has been widely acknowledged that the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China is no longer a communist state. At the same time, scholars have criticized popular images of the PRC as a failed socialist state and the authoritarian, anti-liberal (somehow therefore anti-Western) â€˜other.â€™ This cultural history course examines Chinaâ€™s political, economic, and intellectual transformations of the 1980s and 1990s to challenge the notion of China as a monolithic entity. We interrogate the promises and perils of â€œpostsocialismâ€? as an adequate concept to address the emergent forms of labor, gender, and artistic exploitation in China.","title":"Goodbye Mao: China's Post Socialist Transformations","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
