{"moduleCode":"ME4253","title":"Biomaterials Engineering","description":"Biomaterials involve the integration of engineering materials with biological entities in the body. The success of any implant or medical device depends very much on the biomaterial used. This course introduces students to life science topics. Students gain an appreciation of multidisciplinary approach to problem solving. Topics include metals, polymers, ceramics and composites use as implants, host-tissue response, materials selection, relationship between structure-composition-manufacturing process, evaluation of implants, sterilization and packaging, regulatory approvals, and suitable case studies. Video presentations and lectures complement the breadth covered in this course. Students enjoy project-based case studies which provoke curiosity, peer evaluation and group dynamics.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"LT2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]}]}
