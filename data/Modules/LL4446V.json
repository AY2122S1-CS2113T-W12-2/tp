{"moduleCode":"LL4446V","title":"Comparative Constitutionalism in Southern Asia","description":"This course provides an overview of the theory and practice of constitutionalism in four countries that are located in South and South East Asia: India, Indonesia, Singapore and Sri Lanka. Two of these are among the largest, most pluralistic nations in the world, while the remaining two are small island states. All four nations experienced long periods of colonial rule, which continues to have a decisive impact on their post-colonial legal and constitutional orders. The course will be of interest to those who seek to study constitutionalism against larger societal debates about economic development, cultural values, and human rights.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.\nFor students from other jurisdictions, having completed a basic course on constitutional law – in any jurisdiction – is sufficient.","preclusion":"LL4446/LL5446/LL6446/LLJ5446 Comparative Constitutionalism in Southern Asia","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
