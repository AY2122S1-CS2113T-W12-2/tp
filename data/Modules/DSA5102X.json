{"moduleCode":"DSA5102X","title":"Foundations of Machine Learning","description":"The module introduces the concepts, theories and methods of machine learning. It provides a high-level view to modern algorithms, discuss their theoretical basis, and illustrate their applications to real-world problems arising from mining big data, such as recommendion system for online shopping and diagnosis of rare diseases. Major topics include: probabilistic reasoning, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension, support vector machines, basic learning theory, reinforcement learning, deep learning.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","preclusion":"DSA5102, CS5339","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 30, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}]}]}
