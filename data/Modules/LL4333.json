{"moduleCode":"LL4333","title":"International Criminal Law Clinic","description":"This clinical course introduces students to the law, practice, and implementation of international criminal law. Students will learn and examine the content and application of substantive and procedural law on core international crimes—war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and aggression—that attract individual criminal responsibility under international law. As part of the assessment, students will work on research projects in collaboration with the ICRC. Students will be exposed to ‘real world’ problems and learn the legal knowledge, professional skills, and critical thinking expected of those working in this field. This course will require substantial student initiative, participation and collaboration.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.\nNo auditing","preclusion":"If there is any other substantive international criminal law course offered by colleagues as there will be substantive overlap.\n\nLL4333V/LL5333V/LL6333V International Criminal Law Clinic","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
