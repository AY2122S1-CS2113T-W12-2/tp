{"moduleCode":"EE4205","title":"Quantum Communication and Cryptography","description":"This module introduces engineering undergraduate\nstudents to the basic concepts of quantum communication\ntechnology, focusing on applying analytical methods of\nECE to study quantum communication systems. In\nparticular, it aims to provide engineering students with the\nnecessary skills for the analysis of practical quantum\ncommunication devices. The topics include nonlocal\ngames, quantum cryptography, randomness quantification,\nquantum random number generators and quantum secure\ncommunication. The module only requires that the students\nhave basic understandings of probability theory, statistics,\nlinear algebra, and communication systems. No quantum\nphysics background is required.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"For EE students: EE2012/EE2012A (Analytical methods in\nECE) and EE2023 (Signals and Systems) ;\n\nFor CEG students: ST2334 (Probability and Statistics) and\nCG2023 (Signals and Systems)","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
