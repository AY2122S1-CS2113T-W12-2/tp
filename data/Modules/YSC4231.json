{"moduleCode":"YSC4231","title":"Parallel, Concurrent and Distributed Programming","description":"This module will cover main concepts and programming paradigms for developing parallel concurrent and distributed systems, which is vital for implementing high-performance applications in areas such as machine learning, cloud computing, and databases --- areas with an extremely high demand for well-trained software engineers. \n\nThe course contents will include both practical (about 70%) as well as a theoretical component, giving the students the basis to design concurrent algorithms, and reason about their correctness, as well as to be able to design experiments for estimating the performance of the designed algorithms.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC1212 Introduction to Computer Science and YSC2229 Introductory Data Structures and Algorithms or with the permission of the instructor.","preclusion":"YSC3248 Parallel, Concurrent and Distributed Programming","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1430,"endTime":1730,"venue":"UTSRC-GLR","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
