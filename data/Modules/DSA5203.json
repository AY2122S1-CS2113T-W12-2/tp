{"moduleCode":"DSA5203","title":"Visual Data Processing and Interpretation","description":"This course aims at presenting the fundamentations and\nimportant computational algorithms that are very related to\nimportant applications in visual information processing and\nanalysis: from image acquisition to processing, and to\ninterpretation/understanding. The emphasis is on the tight\nintegration of mathematical foundations, numerical\nalgorithms, and programming implementation techniques\nrelated to industrial applications.\n\nMajor topics include: fundamentals for pictorial data\nacquisition and processing, Computational method for 3D\nreconstruction, Visual data categorization and\nsegmentation, computational methods for visual learning\nand their applications in pattern analysis.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA4230 or departmental approval","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Dec 2, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1900,"endTime":2200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":200}]},{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1300,"venue":"LT21","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]}]}
