{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"Not applicable to USP modules.","description":"This course prepares students for intellectual life beyond the university by modelling and asking students to engage in responsible reading, thinking, teaching, writing, and dialogue. The module will be taught by a multidisciplinary faculty of four and will examine a theme from several disciplinary perspectives. Students will be challenged to critically read and productively respond to assumptions, evidence, and methods from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. This module builds upon and expands USPâ€™s goal of developing socially engaged thinkers, readers, and writers with the skills necessary to understand and intervene in debates concentrated in but relevant beyond specific disciplines and academia.","title":"Critical Reflection","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","workload":[0,4,0,4,2],"prerequisite":"Open to students in years 3 and above","corequisite":"Not applicable to USP modules.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"USR4002A","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":22,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":22,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":22,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":22,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":23,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":23,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["Unknown","B"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR1","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR1","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":20,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["Unknown","B"]}]}
