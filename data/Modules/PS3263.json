{"moduleCode":"PS3263","title":"Comparative Study of Development","description":"This module examines the politics of economic development and underdevelopment. Students are introduced to major political issues in developing countries and to political science frameworks for understanding those issues. Themes covered include state-building, the relationship between development and democracy, the state’s role in industrialisation, development problems and development policy. Specific countries are used as cases to illustrate – and criticise – arguments about politics and development, but the focus in this module is on common themes rather than the political histories of particular nations.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
