{"moduleCode":"PS4239","title":"Seminar in International Relations of Southeast Asia","description":"This advanced seminar explores the international politics of Southeast Asia using new and innovative theories from International Relations (IR). Southeast Asia is at the crossroads of a range of contemporary dynamics: from US-China power-shifts, and South China Sea disputes, to democratic transitions (Burma) and populist authoritarian rollbacks (Philippines). The scholarly study of Southeast Asian IR has not kept pace with the region, however. This module draws on IR practice theory, international political sociology, feminist theory, emotions theory, and diplomatic history to examine how colonialism, class, ethnicity, gender, emotions, domestic politics, regime types (democracy/authoritarianisms) etc., shape Southeast Asian IR.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in PS or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"LT11","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
