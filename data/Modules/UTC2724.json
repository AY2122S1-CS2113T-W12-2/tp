{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"UTC27% or UTS2711","description":"This module takes a social systems approach underpinned by interdisciplinarity to survey the connections and linkages of policymaking and governance vis-à-vis religious actors in Singapore. Balancing between theory and application, and between historical narrative and focus on the contemporary, this module interrogates a wide and complex array of religious-related factors which may influence the government in its policymaking process and the implementation of public policy, secularism in Singapore notwithstanding. This module also investigates how the myriad of religious factors can effect social change and determine the direction of the policies of the government vis-à-vis politico-economic and socio-cultural issues in Singapore.","title":"Religion, Governance and Policymaking in Singapore","department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC2724","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["GEM1918","GEM1919","UTC1700","UTC1701","UTC1702"]}}
