{"moduleCode":"CE5805B","title":"Design for Manufacture and Assembly","description":"Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) aims at ease of  manufacture and assembly efficiency in order to increase overall  productivity in construction. With this design approach, waste  can be eliminated, construction time can be reduced drastically  and cost can be lowered. This course discusses the concepts of constructability and examines in detail the principles of DfMA from the perspective of manufacture and assembly. It also covers logistical considerations to realise just?in?time production  and delivery. BIM and digital technologies will also be discussed.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":4,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"LT1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"LT1","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"LT2","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
