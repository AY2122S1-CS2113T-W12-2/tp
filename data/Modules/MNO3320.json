{"moduleCode":"MNO3320","title":"Managing Change","description":"All of us have experienced change in our lives. Change is often regarded with mixed feelings of excitement, fear and uncertainty. As a business graduate there will be instances in which you will be a participant and observer in organisational change. At other times, you will have the opportunity and responsibility of managing planned changes in organisations. This course aims to prepare you for such opportunities. This course is organised around these major questions: Why is organisational change so difficult? How can I lead and manage change in organisations? What tools and processes can I use to manage change? When and how should these tools be used and what are the strengths and drawbacks of each? Why do some change efforts fail? Why do some others succeed?","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Management and Organisation","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"MNO1001 Management and Organisation or \nMNO1001X Management and Organisation or\nPL3239 Industrial and Organisational Psychology","preclusion":"BH3313A or BZ3503 or BK3305","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
