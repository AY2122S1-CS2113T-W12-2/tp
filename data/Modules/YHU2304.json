{"moduleCode":"YHU2304","title":"Global Histories of Slavery","description":"It has been estimated that 12 million African slaves were shipped to the Americas between 16th and the 19th centuries. Few people are aware, however, that half a million African slaves were also transported to various locations in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea during the same period. This course explores the trafficking in and employment of slaves in a comparative and global context from ancient Rome until today. We will examine the role slavery (in its various forms) has played in the development of empires spanning the Atlantic and Indian Oceans over many centuries.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"First Semester Common Curriculum modules only:\nYCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and\nYCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 and\nYCC1122 Quantitative Reasoning and\nYCC1121 Comparative Social Inquiry","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
