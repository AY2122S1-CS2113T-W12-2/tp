What factors contribute to positive life outcomes? Is successful living predicated simply by demographics or do social attitudes lead to a happy life? Are these two factors linked? We explore 40 years of data to answer questions surrounding the relationship between demographics, attitude, and the quality of life of individuals.","title":"Quantitative Reasoning Foundation: Pursuit of Happiness","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","workload":[0,4,0,4,2],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UQF2101J","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-SR2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
