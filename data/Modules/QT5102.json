{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module introduces physics/engineering graduate students to the fundamentals of quantum cryptography technology, focusing on mature applications like quantum key distribution and quantum random number generation. The module covers the security definitions of quantum cryptography, security proofs in the finitekey regime, device modelling, side-channel attacks, and counter measures. Towards the end of the module, when most of the tools/concepts are in place, we will analyse the security of an actual quantum key distribution experiment, and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. This module requires some basic quantum information/optics knowledge.","title":"Security of Practical Quantum Cryptography","department":"Center for Quantum Technologies","faculty":"NUS Graduate School","workload":[3,1,0,2,4],"prerequisite":"1.
