{"moduleCode":"CM5263","title":"Advanced Inorganic Electronic Materials","description":"Advanced inorganic electronic materials have attracted a lot of interest recently for their unique electronic, mechanical, optical, thermal and chemical properties, and potential applications in future devices. This module covers the theory, synthesis \u0026 processing, structure-property relationships, applications and current frontiers, of the four main families of 2D materials: (i) graphene and related materials; (ii) transition-metal dichalcogenides; and (iii) perovskites. Learners will gain the advanced knowledge needed to guide the further development or deployment of these materials in advanced manufacturing, especially in electronics.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2200,"venue":"LT28","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}]}]}
