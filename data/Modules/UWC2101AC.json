{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module explores how science, as a fundamentally human endeavor, is shaped by the social contexts in which it is practiced. Students will study the social production, circulation, and uptake of scientific knowledge through a series of case studies drawn from the interdisciplinary field of Science and Technology Studies.\nStudents will gain an appreciation of the social processes scientists rely upon to arrive at truths and how scientific ideas and techniques transform once publically circulated. The module will culminate in individual research projects analysing the social contours and consequences of current scientific debates.","title":"Writing & Critical Thinking: The Social Life of Science","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","workload":[0,4,0,3,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UWC2101AC","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-TR1","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"USP-TR1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
