{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"Students who have already read an UTW2001% module.","description":"This module explores how online interactions foster collective identities premised on real/imagined social, economic and political injustice. The 20th century generated identity politics, with its focus on a shared loss of dignities resulting from prolonged colonial or imperial oppression. Evolving political and social settings gradually led to movements centred around distinct group identities (feminist movements, civil rights movements etc.). Advancements in digital communication in the new millennium have led to new variants of online collective identities. This module will examine how virtual identity politics is impacting offline politics, and demanding changes to socio-economic and political landscapes both locally and globally.","title":"Alter ego / authentic self?
