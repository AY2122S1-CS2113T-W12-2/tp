{"moduleCode":"CLC3307","title":"Literacy and Community Development","description":"With the rapid growth of digital technology and the evolving competencies needed for individuals to participate meaningfully in contemporary society, it is crucial for the community development field to view literacy as social practices, and more than a set of technical, unitary skills in reading and writing. This module introduces students to various community-based approaches to literacy, such as critical literacy, multi literacies, participatory literacy education and social partnerships. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we will also examine the practices, contexts and power relations concerning literacy that are essential to community development.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chua Thian Poh Comm Leader Center","faculty":"NUS","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1300,"venue":"UT-AUD1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
