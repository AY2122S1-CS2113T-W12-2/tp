{"moduleCode":"BN4404","title":"Bioelectromechanical Systems - Biomems","description":"Students are advised to have fundamental knowledge in biochemistry and/or organic chemistry. This module is designed as an elective module to the bioengineering undergraduates. It will provide students with background and basic knowledge of bioMEMs and introduce some useful techniques as well. Students will have a basic understanding of the principles, current state and prospects of bioMEMs using what they have learned. The module will focus on major topics such as microfabrication technologies, micropatterning of biocompatible materials, microengineering of biomolecules, cells and tissues, biochips, biosensors, and the frontiers in bioMEMs","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Stage 3 \u0026 4 Engineering students","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 30, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EA-06-03","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}]}]}
