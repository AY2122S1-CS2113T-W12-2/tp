{"moduleCode":"EE5801","title":"Electromagnetic Compatibility","description":"The objective of this module is to introduce the fundamental concepts, theories and practices in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). The module covers topics from the basics of EMC to radiated and conducted emission and susceptibility, cross-talk, shielding and advanced topics of system level design for EMC. Different test and measurement techniques will also be covered. Computational modelling techniques for analysing and reducing EMC problems will be introduced.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"[applicable to UG level students only] EE4101 and EE4112; or\n\n[Advisory applicable to GD level students only] Requires background knowledge such as EE2023, EE2011, PC2020, EE4101, EE4112 or equivalent.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 4, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E5-03-22","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
