{"moduleCode":"YHU2205","title":"Integrative Music Theory 1","description":"Integrative Music Theory I is a comprehensive introduction to music understanding and musicianship. Students will gain command of music rudiments (notation, clefs, intervals, triads, meter, rhythm), as well as augment and refine their everyday activities as music performers and listeners, by developing aural skills in recognising chords and sight-singing. The course will source musical examples from diverse genres and geographies, and will cover both Western art music and jazz/pop approaches to harmony. In Semester 2, Integrative Music Theory II will further hone and build on the skills and concepts examined in Integrative Music Theory I.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","preclusion":"MUT1201 Introduction to Classical Music Composition","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 26, 2021, 2:30:00 PM","examDuration":180,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1030,"venue":"Y-BlackBox","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1030,"venue":"Y-BlackBox","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
