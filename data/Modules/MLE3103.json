{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The Wright brothers built their aeroplane out of wood, Spitfires were all-metal constructions, and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is 80% composite by volume. Materials Scientist and Engineers have enjoyed remarkable success in developing superior materials, but with the huge range of materials available to us today, how does one pick the right material for a given application? This module focusses on the engineering aspects of materials design and selection, considering, for example, the intended function, constraints and limits, performance criteria, environmental conditions, economics and business issues. Case studies across a wide range of application areas will be introduced.","title":"Materials Design: Aerospace to Biomedical Applications","department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2,0.5,1.5,0.5,5.5],"prerequisite":"MLE1101 or MLE2104 or MLE1001 or MLE1002 or MLE2102","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MLE3103","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["MLE1101","MLE2104","MLE1001","MLE1002","MLE2102"]}}
