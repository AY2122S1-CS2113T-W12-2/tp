{"moduleCode":"CE5307BQB","title":"Ocean Environmental Loads","description":"The determination of wave and wind loading on structures is an integral step in the design of marine structures. The module will focus the potential and diffraction theories on wave loading. These fundamental theories are used widely in the design of offshore infrastructure and renewable energy. The module will also focus on the wind loading which is fundamental to the design of offshore wind turbines.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Knowledge in water wave mechanics or equivalent","preclusion":"CE5307, OT5201","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
