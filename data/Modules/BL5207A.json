{"moduleCode":"BL5207A","title":"Topics In Developmental Biology","description":"Developmental biology is the study of the process and mechanism of a single cell developing into a complex organism. This module will focus on animal models. We will start with the background knowledge in the first half of the module, followed by selected topics in hot areas in developmental biology, e.g. neural development, angiogenesis and vascular development, endoderm development, endocrine glands, signal transduction, embryonic stem cells etc. These topics will be rotated in different years. Thus this module aims at those students who have missed the developmental biology module in their undergraduate programmes as well as those who are working in this and related fields.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Basic knowledge in biology at undergraduate level","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
