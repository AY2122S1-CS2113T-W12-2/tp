{"moduleCode":"CE5316B","title":"Water Resources Modeling for Urban Catchments","description":"This course introduces CE students to practical issues in the process from data collection to modelling rainfall to runoff. The focus will be on urban environments where the impact of flooding is magnified due to high population density. Students will collect, clean and use data to setup and run a basic catchment rainfall-runoff model. The understanding gained will provide students with a greater appreciation in the methodology used to translate fundamental knowledge to practical real-world situations specifically floods in an urban catchment.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CE3132 Water Resources Engineering, or equivalent","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 23, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":90,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
