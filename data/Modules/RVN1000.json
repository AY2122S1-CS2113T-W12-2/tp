{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This interdisciplinary module takes a close look at how we consume resources in our daily activities and the resulting sustainability issues, through a holistic analysis of the underlying social, environmental and economic drivers. Through fieldtrips and direct engagement with local communities, we will contextualize these issues to highlight the ways in which planetary resource consumption impacts communities. We will work collaboratively with communities to combat sustainability issues. Synthesizing these learning experiences to evaluate current solutions, we will position ourselves on the issue of resource consumption with respect to the role of the industry, the community and the individual.","title":"Engaging Communities in Sustainability","department":"Ridge View Residential College","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"RVN1000","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"G1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RVR-SRM02","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"G4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RVR-SRM02","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"G6","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RVR-SRM02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"G2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RVR-MPR02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"G3","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RVR-MPR02","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"G5","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RVR-SRM02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
