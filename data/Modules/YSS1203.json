This module serves as an introduction to economics and the basic mathematical tools for economic analysis. It covers topics in microeconomics, macroeconomics, univariate calculus, and systems of equations.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","preclusion":"A level Mathematics and Economics (or equivalent Mathematics and Economics courses).","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
