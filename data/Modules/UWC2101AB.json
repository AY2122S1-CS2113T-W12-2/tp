{"moduleCode":"UWC2101AB","title":"Writing and Critical Thinking: What is Wisdom?","description":"The University Scholars Program aims to be a “community of people who are curious, critical, courageous, and engaged”. Although we rarely think of it in this way, an older tradition would call such qualities aspects of wisdom. In this module, we will study the concept of wisdom from different disciplinary angles, ranging from philosophy to neurobiology and cultural studies. We will discuss key aspects of wisdom such as judgment and self-transcendence, study how wisdom can be developed, and consider how it might be relevant in professional life or even help to solve world problems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"USP-TR1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"USP-TR1","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12}]}]}
