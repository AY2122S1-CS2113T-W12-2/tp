{"moduleCode":"LI5204B","title":"Modelling for Supply Chain Optimization","description":"This module aims to provide a hands-on learning\nopportunity through the use of an easy-to-understand tool\nfor students to address a wide range of supply chain\nmanagement (SCM) problems. The tool allows students to\nmodel and focus on management decision analysis and\nuse KPIs for operational, customer and financial\nperformance measurement and decision-making.\nThe module covers supply chain simulation and\noptimization examples via developing and building models\nand evaluating KPIs, and discusses how to use these\nmodels and their simulation and optimization results to\nimprove management decision-making.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Logistics Inst - Asia Pac","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"LI5204A Decision Support for Supply Chain, or approval of course instructor.","preclusion":"LI5204 Supply Chain Simulation and Optimization","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
