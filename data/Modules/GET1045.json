{"moduleCode":"GET1045","title":"Structures of Conversation","description":"What are the elements that go into organising a conversation? This module examines the intricacy and complexity of conversational structure such as the emergent structure of the talk, its prosodic features, gesture, eye-gaze coordination, etc. in everyday life. Students learn the tools and methods of Conversation Analysis (CA) to analyze micro-level human interactions and everyday talk-in-interactions. Placing conversation as the primordial site of human society, CA uses naturalistic conversational data as empirical evidence to discover how people negotiate, construct and perpetuate societal norms through everyday conversation, and how even routine interaction is meaningful and achieved collaboratively with others.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Japanese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GEX1025","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
