{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The module examines the appeal of s/f as a serious fictional engagement with our consensual sense of reality. It addresses fantasy, speculative fiction, and science fiction as forms of narrative engaged in â€œworld-buildingâ€? and â€œword-shaping,â€? studying such fictional constructs as forms of sociological and anthropological knowledge.
