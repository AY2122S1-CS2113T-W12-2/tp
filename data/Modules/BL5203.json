{"moduleCode":"BL5203","title":"Molecular Recognition and Interactions","description":"Molecular recognition forms the basis of cell signaling networks that are used in various organisms to regulate responses to extracellular and intracellular stimuli. This module focuses on recent progress in our understanding of how various signals are integrated and regulated at the molecular level to ensure cell homeostasis. The mechanisms underlying such regulation including the host cell defense will be examined while pathologies related to signaling defect as possible targets of intervention will also be demonstrated using molecular modeling. Students with background in biology and chemistry and interested in protein-ligand interaction and drug designs are recommended to read this module.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students should have read Biology and Chemistry at undergraduate level","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"S16-0309","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"S16-0309","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
