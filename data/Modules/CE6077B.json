{"moduleCode":"CE6077B","title":"Numerical Methods for Environmental Flows","description":"This course builds on the fundamental concepts of numerical methods introduced\nin CE6077A and applies it to the transport processes of environmental systems such as the atmosphere, freshwater systems, estuaries, coastal seas and oceans.The focus will be on how numerical methods impact solutions due to the fundamental transport equations.\n\nThe module will equip students to understand the importance of transport processes to environmental impacts, limitations of computer/mathematical models to solve the transport processes and how to obtain relevant solutions given the limitations of the models.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CE2134 or equivalent","preclusion":"CE5311, CE5377/CE6077, CE6003","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E1-06-16","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
