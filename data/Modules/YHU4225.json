{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"YHU3253 Imperial Outlaws: Social Deviants in the Age of Empires","description":"This course studies figures who engaged in various forms of illicit oceanic commerce during the â€œgolden ageâ€? of sail. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the wealth and warfare triggered by the expansion of European empires generated lucrative opportunities. Operating in vast and largely unregulated oceanic economies, pirates, privateers, and smugglers skirted imperial laws and violated trade regulations. At times, they were punished as outlaws, only to be celebrated as national heroes on other occasions. During the semester, we will study the historical conditions that made illegal trade both attractive and accessible to a large number of people. We will also explore the enduring popularity of these figures in popular culture.","title":"Empireâ€™s Outlaws: Piracy, Privateering, and Smuggling in the Age of Sail","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0.5,2.5,0,2.5,7],"prerequisite":"Year 1 and 2 Common Curriculum modules and at least one module in History.
