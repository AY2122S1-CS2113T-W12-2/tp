{"moduleCode":"CE3132","title":"Hydrology and Free Surface Flows","description":"This course introduces the basic principles of surface water resources: hydrology and free surface flows. Fundamental concepts of the hydrological cycle, such as: precipitation and evapotranspiration, runoff generation and concentration, response of a drainage basin, river network and reservoir to rainfall; frequency analysis of rainfall and flood extremes, design of ponds, reservoirs, river flow and catchment management, are covered. \nThe free surface flow portion covers the basic free surface open channel steady flow topics of uniform flow, specific energy, and surface profiles. Students will be introduced to unsteady gradually varying flow and the St. Venant equation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CE2134","preclusion":"TCE3132","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 26, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"02","startTime":1200,"endTime":1300,"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":50},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT7","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":180},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"LT7","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":180},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1100,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E1-06-01","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":50}]}]}
