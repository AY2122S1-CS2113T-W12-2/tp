{"moduleCode":"SE5247","title":"Country Studies: Vietnam","description":"Vietnam is a country of apparent contradictions, where a ruling Communist party espouses freemarket economics, a young and optimistic population traces its origins back more than 4000 years, and a sustained engagement with China coexists with a fierce commitment to national independence. This module makes sense of some of these contradictions by exploring key issues in Vietnam’s past and present such as imperialism, nationalism, regionalism, Confucianism, colonial rule, war, Communism, economic reform, and the environment.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2130,"venue":"AS1-0211","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":20}]}]}
