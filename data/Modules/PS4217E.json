{"moduleCode":"PS4217E","title":"Major Political Thinkers: Oakeshott","description":"Politics in a modern state is the art of living together within a framework of enforceable laws, and at its centre is deliberation about what those laws should\nbe. Michael Oakeshott provides a coherent theory of politics in these terms while locating politics within a wider range of concerns including science, history, ethics, religion, rhetoric, education, human nature, and the foundations and limits of knowledge. This breadth makes his thought particularly well?suited to acquiring a comprehensive view of political experience and ideas in the modern world.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2012-2014:\n(1) Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCs in EU/LA [French/German]/recognised modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track. \n(2) PS2204/EU2204\n\nCohort 2015 onwards:\n(1) Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCs in EU/LA [French/German/Spanish]/ recognised modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n(2) PS2204/EU2204","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
