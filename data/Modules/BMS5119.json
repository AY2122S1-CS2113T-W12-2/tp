{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Family firms play an important role in all economies, but especially so in Asia, where family firms not just dominate the small firm category but also constitute the majority of companies listed on most Asian stock exchanges. This course provides students the opportunity to develop a deep understanding of family firms across Asia, with examples from ASEAN countries, India, China, Korea, and Japan. Aside from a focus on how to sustain a family firm from the perspective of the family, the course will also analyze family firms from an outsiderâ€™s perspective, including investors, partners, executives, and policy makers.","title":"Asian Family Business","department":"BIZ Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"BMS5119","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ1-0304","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":34,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
