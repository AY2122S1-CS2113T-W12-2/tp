{"moduleCode":"PP5179","title":"Environmental Social Science","description":"An inadvertent outcome of economic progress is pollution and environmental degradation. This trade off is faced by every decision-maker, and this module draws on knowledge from various disciplines in social sciences to characterize this problem and study possible policy responses. This module provides a economics and policy perspective on environmental challenges. It is divided into two parts with the first half on using economics frameworks to develop policy responses, and the second half on the process and politics of environmental policymaking. This course will equip students with skills and ways of thinking to better navigate environmental problems, policy design, and implementation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"LKY_SR3-1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90}]}]}
