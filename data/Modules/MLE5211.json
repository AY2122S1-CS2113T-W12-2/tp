{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"MLE4206 Current topics on Nanomaterials","description":"The module provides a foundation for students interested in\ndoing research into nanomaterials. It starts by explaining to\nstudents how as a materialâ€™s dimensions enters the\nnanoscale its mechanical, electronic, magnetic and optical\nproperties are altered in manner that results in unique\nbehaviours that are vastly different from their bulk\ncounterparts. The module will finish with aspects of current\nresearch on nanomaterials.","title":"Nanomaterials","department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0.5,0,0,6.5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MLE5211","attributes":{"grsu":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-05","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-05","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":180,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EA-06-05","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-04-28T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
