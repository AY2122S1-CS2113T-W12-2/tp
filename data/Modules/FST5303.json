{"moduleCode":"FST5303","title":"Modern Human Nutrition","description":"Good health maintenance and effective prevention of chronic diseases through nutrition are complex and multifactorial. Using chronic diseases and their comorbidities as primary examples, this module will inform students on the scientific basis which underlie new dietary strategies to manage health and diseases. The interplay between an individual’s genetic makeup, microbiome and nuero-physiological state with the diet will be investigated and their impact on our general health and susceptibility to diseases at the population and individual level will be discussed. Other emerging topics in advanced nutritional research eg. chrono-nutrition, dietary restriction and design of personalized foods and diets will also be covered.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Food Science and Technology","faculty":"Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
