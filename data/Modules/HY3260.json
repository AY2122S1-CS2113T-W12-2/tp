{"moduleCode":"HY3260","title":"Chinese Migrations in World History","description":"This module surveys the major patterns and themes of Chinese migrations since 1400. From merchants under the tributary trade system, to indentured and free labour in the industrialising age, as well as the making of new citizens in multi-culturalist nation-states, students will examine the social experience of long-distance migration through regional and global processes of political-economic change. In addition to academic texts, students will read official documents, family letters, memoirs, and novels to address enduring questions in the history of human migration – why do people leave their homes, and what remains when they adapt to their lands of adoption?","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
