{"moduleCode":"LSM3217","title":"Human Ageing","description":"This module will explore the physiological changes during ageing. Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality globally and sarcopenia is a major cause of disability and frailty among older adults, which decrease healthy lifespan. We will review the mechanism underlying the functional deterioration of system ageing. Moreover, we will also discuss the emerging evidence to explain how motor neuron and immune cells might contribute and respond to system ageing.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physiology","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"LSM2233","preclusion":"YSC3255","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]}]}
