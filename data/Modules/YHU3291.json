{"moduleCode":"YHU3291","title":"Sacrifice, Sex, and Power in Medieval Kashmir","description":"Kashmir became an important centre of philosophy, religion and literature in the early medieval period (850-1050), with Buddhism and different kinds of Hinduism vying with each other for royal patronage. Orthodox Brahmins performed sacrifice and practiced ritual purity, Buddhism cultivated inner purity of the mind that leads to salvation (nirv??a), while new forms of Hinduism called Tantra rejected ritual purity in the belief that impurity – such as ritual sex outside caste – leads to power and success. This course will examine these concerns by focusing on a play, Much Ado About Religion, and a philosophical text, The Essence of Supreme Truth.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
