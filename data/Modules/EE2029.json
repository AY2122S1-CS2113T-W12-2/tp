{"moduleCode":"EE2029","title":"Introduction to Electrical Energy Systems","description":"This module covers the fundamental principles of modern\nelectrical energy systems; including three-phase analysis,\nelectric generations, electric loads, and power electronic\nconverters. Students will learn how to analyse, model, and\npredict the performance of energy systems and devices\nincluding single-phase and three-phase systems,\ntransformers, and various types of generators. Students\nwill develop a broad systems perspective and an\nunderstanding of the principal elements of electrical\nenergy systems. This will serve as the foundation of\nhigher-level topics in power engineering. Furthermore,\nlectured materials are relevant to PE exams for preparing\nstudents to work effectively in complex electrical\nengineering problems.","moduleCredit":3.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"EE2111A / EE1111B / EE1112 / EG1112 / CG1111","preclusion":"EE3506C, EE2022","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 26, 2021, 2:30:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":70},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":70}]},{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 30, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":160},{"classNo":"02","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E3-03-10","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25},{"classNo":"04","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E3-03-10","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"LT7A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":160},{"classNo":"03","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E3-03-10","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E3-03-10","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25}]}]}
