{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"EE3506C, EE2022","description":"This module covers the fundamental principles of modern\nelectrical energy systems; including three-phase analysis,\nelectric generations, electric loads, and power electronic\nconverters. Students will learn how to analyse, model, and\npredict the performance of energy systems and devices\nincluding single-phase and three-phase systems,\ntransformers, and various types of generators. Students\nwill develop a broad systems perspective and an\nunderstanding of the principal elements of electrical\nenergy systems. This will serve as the foundation of\nhigher-level topics in power engineering. Furthermore,\nlectured materials are relevant to PE exams for preparing\nstudents to work effectively in complex electrical\nengineering problems.","title":"Introduction to Electrical Energy Systems","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2.5,0.5,1,0,3.5],"prerequisite":"EE2111A / EE1111B / EE1112 / EG1112 / CG1111","moduleCredit":"3","moduleCode":"EE2029","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":70,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":70,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-11-26T06:30:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":160,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"02","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[9,10],"venue":"E3-03-10","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"04","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[9,10],"venue":"E3-03-10","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT7A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":160,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"03","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[9,10],"venue":"E3-03-10","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[9,10],"venue":"E3-03-10","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"],"examDate":"2022-04-30T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["EE2111A","EE1111B","EE1112","EG1112","CG1111"]}}
