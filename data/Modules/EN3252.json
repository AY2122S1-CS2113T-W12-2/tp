{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module traces the development of how we have come to our contemporary â€œaffective turn.â€? We will begin with where the question of affects supposedly begun: Spinoza. We will then read how Deleuze underscored its importance, and how that has been carried through politically by Brian Massumi today. At the same time, we will be equally invested in Eve Sedgwickâ€™s development of affect for feminist and queer theory in Berlant, Cvetkovich, Love, Edelman, Stewart, Nelson, and others. Finally, we will explore how affect theory affects literary studies with a reading of Ottessa Moshfeghâ€™s My Year of Rest and Relaxation.","title":"The Genealogy of Affect Theory","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"(i) EN1101E AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","corequisite":"So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EN3252","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["EN1101E",{"or":["EN2201","EN2202","EN2203","EN2204","EN2205","EN2207","EN2275","EN2276","EN2277"]}]}}
