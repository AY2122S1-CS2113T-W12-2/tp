{"moduleCode":"LL5335V","title":"Multinational Enterprises and International Law","description":"This  module  examines  the  evolving  regime  for  the regulation  and  protection  of  multinational  enterprises (MNEs)  in  international  law.    Although  MNEs  remain creations  of  domestic  law,  the  cross-border  activities  of MNEs  increasingly  come  within  the  scope  of instruments creating  obligations  and/or  rights  in  international  law.    In assessing the challenges faced by states and MNEs alike with respect to such transnational regulation, the module takes  a  rounded  and interdisciplinary  view  of  the  issues involved,  addressing  both  the  commercial  and  social dimensions of MNE action.  In addition to considering the regulatory powers of individual states, developments under international   instruments   on   human   rights,   labour conditions, finance, taxation and investment are addressed.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"LL4335/LL5335/LL6335 Multinational Enterprises and International Law","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Hybrid_D","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
