{"moduleCode":"GEM1537","title":"Nanotechnology-Smart Phone and Beyond","description":"This course aims to stimulate students’ strong interest in nanoscience and technology through elaboration of the different aspects of na notechnologies from policy, applications (related to everyday lives and exciting students’ imaginations), industry and economic impact, career opportunities and sustainability. We start the course by examining nanotechnologies involved in making a smart phone, and e laborate (using animation and simple macroscopic concepts which student could s ee/feel) the applications in areas of Multi-functional Films, Displays (e.g. OLED), Touch Screens, Batteries, Processors, Data Storage Devices, Smart Sensors and others.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
