{"moduleCode":"YSS4224","title":"Political Order and One-Party Rule","description":"The 20th and 21st centuries have seen an unprecedented global expansion in the number of one-party regimes. Despite not conforming to standard definitions of democracy, these regimes have proven more stable and developed faster than non-democracies with which they are often grouped. In this module, students will gain a deeper understanding of politics within such regimes from a comparative politics perspective. Topics covered include the conditions facilitating the establishment and spread of one-party regimes, how leaders manage threats originating from both inside and outside the regime, the role of elections, and the conditions in which transitions away from regimes occur.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSS1206 Introduction to Comparative Politics or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
