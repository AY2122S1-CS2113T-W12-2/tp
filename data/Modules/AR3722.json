{"moduleCode":"AR3722","title":"Sustainable Environmental System","description":"This course will provide students with an understanding of the concepts of environmental systems and their spatial requirements in an architectural context. The increasing need for building technologies integration within multidisciplinary projects in a modern construction environment will be addressed. The course first focuses on understanding how basic environmental systems (or building services systems, such as mechanical, electrical, plumbing and drainage) are related to the building program and broader built environments. Codes of practice, such as fire safety, will also be addressed. Furthermore, renewable energy and water system in architecture in the green building movement will be discussed.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"SDE1-CL3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"UT-AUD1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"SDE1-CL3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1000,"endTime":1300,"venue":"SDE1-CL2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
