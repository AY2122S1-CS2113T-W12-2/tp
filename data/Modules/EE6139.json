{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"EE5139, EE5139R","description":"The aim of this module is to introduce you to the abstract theory of the quantification, storage, and communication of information. You will learn how to construct codes for compression and error correction.  You will also study the fundamental limits of data compression and channel coding, culminating in the source-channel separation theorem. Along the way you will learn about many important tools required in the mathematical analysis of information processing problems. We will discuss various applications of information theory, for example to statistics and the theory of machine learning.","title":"Information Theory and its Applications (Advanced)","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0,0,4,3],"prerequisite":"Advisory: Requires knowledge of probability and statistics at the level of the undergraduate module such as EE2012 or EE4131","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EE6139","attributes":{"grsu":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT3","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2021-11-29T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["EE2012","EE4131"]}}
