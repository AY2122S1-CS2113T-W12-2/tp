{"moduleCode":"YHU4236","title":"“New” Media: Inquiries into Literature \u0026 Technology","description":"No more adding of “new media”, media scholars have cried out over the recent years, to existing things when what we call “old media” was to quip a seminal phrasing, always already new. The same can be said for the communities and publics that media helped form. As ‘new media’ becomes increasingly ubiquitous in popular and scholarly discourse, we have lost sight of the term’s older origin as the mediation between cultures, politics, identities, and ideologies. Through media theory, literary narratives, films, and artworks, students will learn the post-hermeneutic turn in the humanities, where the idea of “text” is simply one of the dynamic effects of mediality.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2 and one Literature module or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
