{"moduleCode":"USE2304","title":"Singapore: The Making Of A Nation","description":"The course serves as an introduction to history in general and the history of modern Singapore in particular. It adopts a wide-angled approach to an understanding of national heritage, history and identity, with due attention to both international and internal developments which have together shaped present-day Singapore. These developments include the formation of a colonial plural society under British rule, the impact of the Japanese Occupation, the rise of nationalism and political contestation, statehood, merger with and separation from Malaysia, the politics and economics of survival, and the governance of an independent city-state.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"UTSRC-GLR","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":15},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"UTSRC-GLR","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"USP-SR1","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":15},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"USP-SR1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":15}]}]}
