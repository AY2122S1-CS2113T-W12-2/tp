{"moduleCode":"BN2202S","title":"Introduction to Biotransport","description":"This module will present fundamental transport solutions which model the major features of biological flow. The conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in a system will be studied and applied to blood flows in the cardiovascular system. Basic knowledge of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics will also be covered. Bifurcation flow and Hemorheology in macrocirculation and microcirculation will be discussed. Basic mass transfer will be introduced to the students.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"BIE Stage 2 standing and Engineering students doing Minor in Bioengineering","preclusion":"BN2101S","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
