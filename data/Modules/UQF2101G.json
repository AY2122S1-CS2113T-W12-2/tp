{"moduleCode":"UQF2101G","title":"Quantitative Reasoning Foundation: Quantifying Nuclear Risks","description":"This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can \nprovide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach.  \n\nThis module focuses on quantifying aspects of nuclear risks. Students will pose a question related to nuclear risks (e.g. What is the lowest dose of radiation that can lead to cancer?), propose a method to measure the relevant variables, collect the necessary data, and make scientifically justifiable inferences from it. Students will thus perform all aspects of a genuine scientific study, from problem formulation to decision making and final reporting.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","preclusion":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","corequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"USP-TR1","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"USP-TR1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25}]}]}
