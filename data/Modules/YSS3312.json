{"moduleCode":"YSS3312","title":"Food and Sustainability","description":"As societies struggle to cope with global climate change, depletion of natural resources, and loss of biodiversity, we face yet another momentous challenge in the next 50 years: finding ways to nourish our bodies with healthy, safe, and culturally appropriate foods. This module explores the critical discussions and debates on the sustainability of food systems and the merits of what is advocated nowadays as “sustainable food.” The module draws primarily from the theoretical and methodological traditions of political economy/ecology and cultural politics in understanding the complex social and material dimensions of food in an increasingly unsustainable world.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YID1201 Introduction to Environmental Studies or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
