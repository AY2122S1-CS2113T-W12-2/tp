{"moduleCode":"LLJ5016A","title":"Topics in Int’l Criminal Law (A): Aggression","description":"When the judges at the Nuremberg Tribunal handed down\ntheir decision against the German leaders in October\n1946, they declared ‘crimes against peace’ – the initiation\nof aggressive wars – to be ‘the supreme international\ncrime’. At the time, the charge was heralded as a legal\nmilestone, but subsequent events revealed it to be a postwar\nanomaly. This module traces the ebb and flow of the\nidea of criminalising aggression – from its origins after the\nFirst World War, through its high-water mark at the postwar\ntribunals and its abandonment during the Cold War, to\nits recent revival at the International Criminal Court.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or its equivalent","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
