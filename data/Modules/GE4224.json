{"moduleCode":"GE4224","title":"Applied Biogeography","description":"In addition to developing fundamental knowledge in the field of Biogeography, this module also covers the quickly developing technologies (including genomic tools, computer models and Earth observation), big data and quantitative and qualitative forms of analyses that characterise biogeographical applications. In particular the content of the module illustrates how biogeographical understanding can be, and is, used to enable biodiversity to cope with and adapt to rapidly changing ecological conditions. The module has relevance beyond geography, ecology and evolutionary biology to include bioinformatics, global change, conservation, invasion biology, food security and ecosystem services.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed at least 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\n(BES students from both specialisations).\nCompleted 80 MCs of NUS modules before they can read any level-4000 GE modules.
