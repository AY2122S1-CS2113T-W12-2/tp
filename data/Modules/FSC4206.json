{"moduleCode":"FSC4206","title":"Advanced Criminal Litigation – Forensics on Trial","description":"Criminal law does not exist in a vacuum. Forensic evidence can support the elements of a charge, such as drink-driving, rape and drugs consumption. Forensic evidence can also serve as objective evidence to decide who is telling the truth in a he say-she say situation.\nForensic scientists can play a significant role by presenting evidence in a trial, and effective trial lawyers should be equipped with the skills and knowledge to manage, present, and challenge forensic evidence. This interdisciplinary module serves to equip students with effective communication and analytical skills to present and handle forensic evidence in courts.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"FSC2101 or LSM1306","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1400,"venue":"S1A-0217","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
