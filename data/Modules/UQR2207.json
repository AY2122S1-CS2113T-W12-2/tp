{"moduleCode":"UQR2207","title":"Decision Analytics","description":"This module aims to sharpen students’ analytical minds, and to develop skills for decision making such as might be useful in management consulting. Students will appreciate the general decision framework and be familiar with some decision models in this quick and challenging course.\n \nThe focus will be on data-analytic and microeconomic approaches to decision making, with as little use of formulas as practicable. Rather, grasping of broad concepts, extension of intuition and, where appropriate, use of information technology to arrive at decisions, will be emphasized.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
