{"moduleCode":"CN3421A","title":"Process Modeling And Numerical Simulation","description":"This module introduces model formulation and MATLAB programming specially for chemical\nengineering students. This course covers the formulation of process models and necessary\nnumerical techniques for solving the model equations arising in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics,\nheat and mass transfer, reaction engineering, transport phenomena, and process systems\nengineering. The numerical techniques include methods for solving systems of linear and non-linear\nalgebraic equations and systems of linear and non-linear ordinary and partial differential equations.\nDirect and iterative techniques, numerical differentiation and integration, linear regression, error\npropagation, convergence and stability analysis will also be taught in the context of chemical\nengineering problems. Students will learn using various tools (Excel spreadsheet and MATLAB) for\nsolving different numerical problems. This module is targeted at level 3 chemical and environmental\nengineering students.","moduleCredit":3.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"MA1511: Engineering Calculus\nMA1512: Differential Equations for Engineering\nMA1513: Linear Algebra with Differential Equations","corequisite":"CN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 25, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"6","startTime":1700,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"5","startTime":1600,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"7","startTime":1600,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"8","startTime":1600,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1500,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1500,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":230},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1100,"endTime":1300,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":230}]},{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 6, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E1-06-09","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E1-06-09","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E1-06-09","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}]}]}
