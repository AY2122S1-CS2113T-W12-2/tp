{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course provides students the insight of water reclamation and reuse from technology, quality and regulation perspectives, which include planning, health effect, reclamation systems and relevant practice. Through lecture and project, the course covers overview of water reclamation and reuse, contaminants in reuse systems, treatment technologies for water reclamation, wastewater reuse practices, and health risks assessment. This course will enable students to understand the contaminants in reuse systems and treatment technologies for water reclamation. Health risks assessment in wastewater reuse practices is also highlighted. Students learn how to apply the water reclamation system to reclaim water for different purpose with the health effect and regulation aspects properly addressed.","title":"Water Reclamation Engineering, Practice & Mgt","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0,0,1,6],"prerequisite":"ESE3401 Water and Wastewater Engineering or ESE4-standing or higher","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ESE5403","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"ESE3401"}
