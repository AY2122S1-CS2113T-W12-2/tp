{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The journey is an ancient and vibrant motif in literature: journeys can introduce you to the strange and new, take you home, convey you to the recesses of your own mind, end serendipitously or in calamity. Based on the motif of the journey, this course highlights a few of the many extraordinary texts in the sub-Saharan African literary tradition, from the 14th to the 20th centuries. By focusing on primary texts (epics, plays, poetry, biographies, novels and short stories), we will get a sense of the breadth and variety of themes, ideas, encounters, and travels featured in African literary itineraries.","title":"Introduction to African Lit: Sub-Saharan Journeys","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3.5,6],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU2325","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1430","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-KChanrai","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1430","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-KChanrai","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
