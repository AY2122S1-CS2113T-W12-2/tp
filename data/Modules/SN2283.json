{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module is structured keeping in view the different understanding of Sino-Indian relations and competing economic and political policy discourses in the new millennium. In the light of the above, the module re-examines the connections and interactions in India-China relations through historical and contemporary contexts to enhance the awareness of difference in perspectives and raise the level of mutual understanding, particularly from South Asian\nperspectives. It will enable students to critically analyse the ‘realist’ and ‘neo-liberal’ debates in view of a more holistic analysis and better understanding of\nthe bilateral relations between China and India.","title":"China-India Interactions: Changing Perspectives","department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SN2283","attributes":{"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS1-0205","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS2-0413","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS3-0213","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
