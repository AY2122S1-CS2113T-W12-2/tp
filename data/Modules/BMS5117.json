{"moduleCode":"BMS5117","title":"Game Theory For Managers","description":"In modern business environments, uncertainty and strategic interdependence among rivals surround competitive conducts. Conflict interfaces with mutual\ndependence naturally, and decision making in such situations requires one to take into account the moves and countermoves among them. This module provides a\nrigorous non-cooperative game theoretic view for managers to analyse rational decision makings under various conjectural behaviours in such strategic interactions together with strategic moves to possibly influence the outcome for one’s own or mutual gains. Fundamental theory will be well balanced with economic, managerial and personal decision making situation applications. Game experiments will be performed as well.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","preclusion":"BMA5001\nEC3312\nMKT3513\nMKT3812\nMA4264\nBMS5110","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1830,"endTime":2130,"venue":"BIZ1-0204","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":50}]}]}
