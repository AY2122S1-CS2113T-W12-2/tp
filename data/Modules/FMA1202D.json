{"moduleCode":"FMA1202D","title":"Taking Risks: Economics, Psychology, and Biology","description":"Risk taking lies at the heart of business and the economy. Biology, psychology, and economics are converging today into a unified discipline which can deliver a revolutionary approach to understanding how people take risk, to realize greater returns or for recreation. We shall begin with discussing economic models of risk taking incorporating psychological considerations and how they are tested in choice experiments.
