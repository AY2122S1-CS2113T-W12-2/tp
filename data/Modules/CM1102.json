{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"Cohort AY2020/2021 and earlier","description":"This module will deliver a continuous thematic narrative to illustrate some core concepts in chemistry and demonstrate its central role in science. The theme and concepts will be introduced in an intertwined manner throughout the module in three sections – the Environment, Materials and Life. Real world issues such as global warming, pollution, industrialization, energy shortage, sustainability, healthcare and biomedical advancement, etc. will be discussed. Beginning from a molecular viewpoint and connecting it to daily phenomena, students will learn to appreciate key scientific fundamentals while at the same time explore real issues and deliberate on possible future solutions.","title":"Chemistry - The Central Science","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[4,1,0,0,5],"prerequisite":"‘A’ Level H2 Chemistry or its equivalent or CM1417 or CM1417X","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM1102","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":500,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":500,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT27","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT27","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT27","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"5","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown","B"],"examDate":"2021-12-01T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-0224","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-0224","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"5","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-0224","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"6","startTime":"0800","endTime":"0900","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-0224","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT33","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":240,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT33","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":240,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-0224","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-0224","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-05T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["CM1417","CM1417X"]},"fulfillRequirements":["SP2251","CM2112","CM2122","CM2133","CM2143"]}
