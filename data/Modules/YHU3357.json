{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"YSS3211 Human Rights","description":"This course invites students to think more deeply about the nature of human rights â€“ beyond their use as international political agreements, and into their deeper conceptual roots. The goal of the course is to familiarize students with the current debates about the theoretical grounding and justification for human rights, which rights can be said to be human rights, and to think deeply about when and how human rights are invoked and what interventions they are used to justify. \n\nStudents will explore issues related to political philosophy, the theoretical underpinnings of international law and justice, with the goal of ultimately coming to appreciate meaningfully how these ideas shape their own lives.","title":"Philosophy of Human Rights","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,1.5,8],"prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought and with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU3357","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YCC2121"}
