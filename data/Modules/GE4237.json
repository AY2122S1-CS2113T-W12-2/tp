{"moduleCode":"GE4237","title":"Environmental Pollution","description":"Environmental pollution, the introduction of pollutants to the environment through human activity in amounts that can have adverse effects on biota, including humans, and ecosystem services, has in recent years become both more widespread and, in places, more acute. The fundamental principles of environmental pollution are used as a basis for an in-depth examination of the production and release of pollutants and their eventual pollution of the environment, and how pollution processes and effects have varied over time. Students will also consider how problems of environmental pollution can best be addressed - both in terms of their sources and their effects.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"GE Majors: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in Major, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\nBES students: Completed 80 MCs of NUS modules before they can read any level-4000 GE modules.
