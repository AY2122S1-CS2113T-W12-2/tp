{"moduleCode":"GEI1001","title":"Computational Reasoning","description":"Through a series of fun and engaging hands-on activities, this module aims to equip students with the ability to thoughtfully apply computational tools when solving complex real-world problems. In particular, this module aims to impart students with the ability to critically self-evaluate the way they apply these tools, and thus be able to reason effectively in a variety of contexts. They will learn to identify problems and\ndesign solutions, while also developing a critical awareness of the merits and limits of their methods, thereby empowering them to make better-informed decisions and to articulate the reasons for those decisions.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GET1031A Computational Thinking; GET1050","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
