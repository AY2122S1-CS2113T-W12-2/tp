{"moduleCode":"LSM2107","title":"Evolutionary Biology","description":"Evolutionary biology covers the history of life on our planet and the processes that produced the multiple life forms of Earth. Topics include: the origins of life, the eukaryotic cell, and multicellularity; the generation of genetic variation and the sorting of that variation through random processes and through natural and sexual selection; the origin of new traits, new life histories, and new species; the origins of sex, sociality, and altruism; the evolution of humans; and applications of evolutionary biology to solving modern-day problems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"GCE \u0027A\u0027 Level or H2 Biology or equivalent, or LSM1301","preclusion":"LSM1105 or YSC2216","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 20, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":250},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":250}]},{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 30, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"LT26","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":250},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"LT26","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":250}]}]}
