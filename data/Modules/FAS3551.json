{"moduleCode":"FAS3551","title":"FASS Capstone Career Preparation","description":"The module complements the FASS Mentorship Programme, where we connect undergraduates with experienced FASS alumni, who will provide insight and guidance on career and professional development. Students will work on two reports to help them reflect upon their learning journey and career possibilities in a chosen industry sector. Through the process, students will gain a realistic overview of the workplace, sharpen soft skills, apply gained knowledge and expand their network, all fundamental to a job search.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"FASS DO/Office of Programmes","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"NUS FASS undergraduates who have completed 80 MCs.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
