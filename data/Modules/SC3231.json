{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"We live an era in which humans have altered the atmospheric, oceanic, geological conditions of the planet. And yet, even as humans emerge as powerful agents, the contemporary moment is marked by extreme weather, pollution, and extinction. How do we rethink society, relations, economy, and history in order to live with the climate crisis? We will read recent scholarship in anthropology in combination with scholarship from history, STS, political theory, and feminist environmentalism, to think about more-than-human socialities, collective subjectivities, and long-term futures. The course combines critical reading with interactive exercises to think about climate change through the anthropological lens.","title":"Facing the Climate Crisis of the Anthropocene","department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,2,0,2,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SC3231","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
