{"moduleCode":"PH3214","title":"Philosophy and Literature","description":"The course will consider, side by side, certain `philosophical\u0027 works of literature and more orthodox philosophical works.  The idea is to explore the ways and degrees to which it makes sense - also, the ways and degrees to which it does not make sense - to say that this work of fiction (a novel, say) is really about the same thing that this philosophical text is about.  Turning the point around:  when philosophers - like Plato or Nietzsche - employ literary techniques more characteristic of fiction, what philosophical work is hereby done?","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30}]}]}
