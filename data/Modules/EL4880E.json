{"moduleCode":"EL4880E","title":"World Englishes","description":"The module aims to help students acquire a new perspective on the English language in its totality -- not as the language of a few traditional English-speaking countries, but as a bona fide world language with several old and new varieties (‘World Englishes’) which exhibit their own distinctive linguistic features and functions. It provides students with the necessary concepts and tools to analyse the linguistic features as well as social and cultural issues arising from the emergence of English as a world language.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in EL, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
