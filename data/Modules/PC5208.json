{"moduleCode":"PC5208","title":"Superconductivity","description":"The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the microscopic and phenomenological theories of superconductivity. It lays the analytical foundation for the understanding a wide range of modern applications of both low- and high- temperature superconductors. The lecture links established theories with current research activities in the development of the physics and technology of the superconductors. Students should have a background in quantum mechanics and thermal physics.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC4214 or PC4240, or departmental approval","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
