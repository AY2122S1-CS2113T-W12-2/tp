{"moduleCode":"GE3250","title":"Nature and Society","description":"This module introduces conceptual approaches for understanding the myriad relationships between human societies and their biophysical environments. It addresses three key questions. First, how are nature and society interconnected? Second, what theoretical and methodological approaches can be used to study nature-society relationships? Third, how can societal relationships with nature be improved in ways that are sustainable and just? These questions will be explored using different social theories, particularly from the interdisciplinary field of political ecology, which will be applied to contemporary environmental issues. Students will learn how to critically think, discuss, and write about complex nature-society interactions.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GE2221","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 4, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"LT12","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
