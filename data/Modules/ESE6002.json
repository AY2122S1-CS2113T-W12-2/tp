{"moduleCode":"ESE6002","title":"Advanced Environmental Physical Process Analysis","description":"This module introduces the fundamental principles that can be used in the analysis and modelling of basic environmental engineering processes and systems. Specifically, it will examine the material conservation law and its applications, including material balance, mass transfer, reaction kinetics (rate and mechanism) and reaction engineering (reactor performance), etc. Through the discussion, students can better understand why physical processes are expected to function or behave in certain ways and how process performance may be implemented.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Graduate-standing in Environmental Engineering","preclusion":"ESE5002","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
