{"moduleCode":"CN5252","title":"Molecular and computational tools for biotechnology","description":"Biotechnology plays increasingly important roles in chemical manufacturing, because it can utilize\nrenewable resources and carry out the reactions at milder, safer and more environmentally-friendly\nconditions. This module introduces the foundational molecular biology tools that have enabled many\nbiotechnological processes. To enable the students to have hands-on experiences with these theories, this\nmodule is also heavy in using computational tools during teaching and assessments. The computations\nwould allow the students to practice the theories in silico and be able to handle large volume of data that\nare being generated by the omics technologies in many biotechnological applications.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Linear algebra and numerical methods at undergraduate level, Fundamentals of Biochemistry","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E2-0309PC6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
