{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Ways of knowing have always been connected with particular forms of political organisation. For example, the idea of an ascending hierarchy of forms of knowledge culminating in the knowledge of the good found in Plato’s Republic also implies a hierarchical social order capped by an elite of ‘guardians’ who have mastered this sequence; the government of Confucian China required a scholarly elite distinguished by its knowledge of correct ritual essential for preserving the social order. The course examines the changing ways in which knowledge and political power have been mutually implicated in traditional, classical, and modern societies.","title":"The Politics of Knowledge","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,2,7.5],"prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"PS4229","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
