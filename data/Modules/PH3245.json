{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Topics at the intersection of philosophy of mind and language, such as whether thought depends on talk or vice versa, whether we think in words or images, whether those words are words of English or a sui generis mental language just for thinking, whether animals which canâ€™t talk can think and whether the mind is like a computer.
