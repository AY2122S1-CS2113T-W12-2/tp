{"moduleCode":"CS4236","title":"Cryptography Theory and Practice","description":"This module aims to introduce the foundation, principles and concepts behind cryptology and the design of secure communication systems. The emphasis is on the formulation and techniques of various cryptographic primitives, and on the secure usage of such primitives to achieve the goals of confidentially, integrity, and authenticity in both theoretical settings and practical scenarios. Basic topics include pseudorandom functions, symmetric key encryption, public key encryption, message\nauthentication codes, hash functions, digital signatures, key exchange and PKI. Selected topics may include: secret sharing, TCP/IP security, Kerberos, SSL, trusted computing, side-channel attacks.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"((CS2010 or its equivalent) or CS2020 or (CS2040 or its equivalent)) and (MA1100 or (CS1231 or its equivalent)) and CS2107","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 29, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2030,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100}]}]}
