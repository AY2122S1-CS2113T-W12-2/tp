{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course examines the diverse histories and features of neoliberalism, which is a theory of the political economy that proposes that human well-being can best be advanced through the free market. We begin by learning about the historical conditions that led to the emergence of neoliberalism and the popularization of the ideology of the responsible, self-maximizing individual that lies at the heart of it. We will then examine the effects of neoliberal policies on various societies across the world. Finally, we will discuss whether the mounting public criticisms of neoliberalism will lead to its demise.","title":"Neoliberalism","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,1.5,8],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3320","semesterData":[]}
