{"moduleCode":"CN5111","title":"Optimization of Chemical Processes","description":"Students will learn the fundamentals, methods and software for formulating and solving optimization problems of relevance to chemical engineering. They will study various methods of linear/nonlinear and unconstrained/constrained programming, which would enable them to select and use appropriate solution algorithm and/or software for solving a given problem. They will also execute the various steps in optimization and demonstrate their acquired knowledge by solving a sufficiently complex practical problem of their own choice in a term project. This is for graduate students who wish to learn optimization","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E1-06-08","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}]}]}
