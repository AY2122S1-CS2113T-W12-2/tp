{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Catalysis plays a key role to tackle the increasing societal\ndemand for sustainable production. The module\nintroduces â€œdisruptive innovationsâ€? in catalysis that may\nrevolutionize the way to conduct catalytic reactions, and/or\nfundamentally change the views on catalytic active sites\nand cycles. The module consists of five core contents: 1)\nadvanced catalytic kinetic concepts including multiscale\nmodelling and energetic span model; 2) advanced\nsynthetic procedures affording catalyst with high structural\nprecision and complexity; 3) in situ characterization tools;\n4) catalysis beyond thermal activation; and 5) emerging\nfrontiers, such as auxiliary promotion, dynamic catalysis,\ndata-driven catalyst design etc.","title":"Advanced Topics in Catalysis","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"N.A.","corequisite":"N.A.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CN5160","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-11-29T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
