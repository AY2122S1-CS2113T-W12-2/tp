{"moduleCode":"CN5160","title":"Advanced Topics in Catalysis","description":"Catalysis plays a key role to tackle the increasing societal\ndemand for sustainable production. The module\nintroduces “disruptive innovations” in catalysis that may\nrevolutionize the way to conduct catalytic reactions, and/or\nfundamentally change the views on catalytic active sites\nand cycles. The module consists of five core contents: 1)\nadvanced catalytic kinetic concepts including multiscale\nmodelling and energetic span model; 2) advanced\nsynthetic procedures affording catalyst with high structural\nprecision and complexity; 3) in situ characterization tools;\n4) catalysis beyond thermal activation; and 5) emerging\nfrontiers, such as auxiliary promotion, dynamic catalysis,\ndata-driven catalyst design etc.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"N.A.","corequisite":"N.A.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 29, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
