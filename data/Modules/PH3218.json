It aims to elucidate the assumptions implicit in different ways of thinking about these issues and investigate how issues may be related in the light of these assumptions.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Passed at least one Western philosophy module and at least one relevant Asian philosophy module (depending on whether Chinese or Indian Philosophy is the focus of a particular session), and the department’s permission.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
