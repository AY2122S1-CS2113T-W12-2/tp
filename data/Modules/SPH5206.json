{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"CO5202 Environmental and Occupational Health\nSPH5306 Environmental Health","description":"We live in a densely populated modern city state that earns its living as an international trade and travel hub. Students will learn about constraints and vulnerabilities in our physico-social ecology, and how to balance the natural tropical biosphere and man-made technosphere in the face of climate, economic and lifestyle changes. Risk assessment and management form the basis for health\nprotection, safeguarding against emergent threats, and skills-building in risk communications promotes right attitudes and behaviours for community wellbeing. This module provides a combination of hard and soft science approaches that will guide field epidemiologists in urban health security.","title":"Urban Field Epidemiology","department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean's Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","workload":[3,0,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SPH5206","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":3,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-06-02","end":"2022-06-02"},"venue":"MD1-0901AB","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-05-30","end":"2022-05-30"},"venue":"MD1-0901AB","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-06-03","end":"2022-06-03"},"venue":"MD1-0901AB","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-05-31","end":"2022-05-31"},"venue":"MD1-0901AB","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-06-01","end":"2022-06-01"},"venue":"MD1-0901AB","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
