{"moduleCode":"SPH5206","title":"Urban Field Epidemiology","description":"We live in a densely populated modern city state that earns its living as an international trade and travel hub. Students will learn about constraints and vulnerabilities in our physico-social ecology, and how to balance the natural tropical biosphere and man-made technosphere in the face of climate, economic and lifestyle changes. Risk assessment and management form the basis for health\nprotection, safeguarding against emergent threats, and skills-building in risk communications promotes right attitudes and behaviours for community wellbeing. This module provides a combination of hard and soft science approaches that will guide field epidemiologists in urban health security.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","preclusion":"CO5202 Environmental and Occupational Health\nSPH5306 Environmental Health","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":3,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1800,"venue":"MD1-0901AB","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1800,"venue":"MD1-0901AB","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1800,"venue":"MD1-0901AB","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1800,"venue":"MD1-0901AB","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1800,"venue":"MD1-0901AB","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
