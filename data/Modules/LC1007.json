{"moduleCode":"LC1007","title":"Legal Analysis, Writing And Research II","description":"The objective of this course (together with companion course Legal Writing I) is to develop written/oral communication skills, research skills and analytical skills in first year students. In Legal Writing 2, we will focus on developing persuasive communication skills. Students will learn to: (i) formulate cogent arguments for their clients\u0027 positions; and (ii) convincingly present legal support for such positions. They will be expected to exercise these persuasive skills in multiple media (written, oral) and contexts (in simulated negotiations and courtroom presentations). These exercises will culminate in a hypothetical case or \"moot\" problem. Research assignments will cover statutoryand factual research.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
