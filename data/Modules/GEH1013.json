From pirates to privateers, corsairs to raiders, maritime predators take various names and forms. This module explores the history of pirates and piracy. By examining case studies from the 1400s onwards and by placing pirates into the context of oceanic history and maritime studies, students will be able to demystify the popular images often associated with pirates.","title":"Pirates, Oceans and the Maritime World","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[3,1,0,4,2],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEH1013","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"aliases":["GEC1003"],"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[2,4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":75,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[2,4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
