{"moduleCode":"PC3270","title":"Machine Learning for Physicists","description":"By extracting and predicting insightful correlations within observations of complex physical phenomena, Machine Learning (ML) models push the boundaries of data-driven scientific exploration. This module introduces ML models and their underlying principles, including a short overview of foundational statistics and information theory. Furthermore, students will see applications of ML models to the Physical Sciences (e.g. optics, statistical physics, condensed matter, biological physics). Although this module will be taught in the Python programming language, prior experience in any programming language will nonetheless be helpful.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC2134 Mathematical Methods in Physics I","preclusion":"CS3244 Machine Learning; IT3011 Introduction to Machine Learning and Applications","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S11-0205","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":25}]}]}
