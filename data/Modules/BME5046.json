{"moduleCode":"BME5046","title":"Managing Organisations","description":"Leading individuals, groups, and organisations effectively is key to managerial excellence. Yet, it may pose the most difficult challenges for managers. This course is designed to help you meet this challenge. The course will achieve this objective in three ways. First, it will provide you with a framework for increasing individual, group and organisational performance. Second, it will help you understand and acquire critical leadership knowledge and skills required to shape and manage the behavior of people in organisations. Third, through self-reflection of your own practice at work (“journal”), it will relate the relevance and usefulness of the concepts and management practices discussed in class to your work experiences.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"BME5045: Leadership: Exploration, Assessment and Development\n\nThe pre-requisite is applicable to all students except for late admittances.
