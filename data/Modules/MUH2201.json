{"moduleCode":"MUH2201","title":"Classical Styles and Romantic Spirits","description":"Today’s most widely-known, international concert repertoire is primarily made up of 18th-, 19th-, and early 20th-century European and North American composers and their music. This module presents a look, listen, and study of their music and legacy focusing on two parallel movements in the European tradition: the classical, rococo, galante, emfindsamer stil, and neo-classical; and sturm und drang, romantic, and neo-romantic. The focus of learning in this course is through primary source materials. (Non-conservatory students that can read music are invited to enrol in this course as free elective.)","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
