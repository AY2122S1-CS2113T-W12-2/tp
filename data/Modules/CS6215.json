{"moduleCode":"CS6215","title":"Advanced Topics in Program Analysis","description":"Program analysis techniques allow one to automatically\nanalyse the behaviour of a computer program, to identify\nbugs and performance bottlenecks. This graduate level\nmodule covers advanced topics in program analysis that\nare of current research or application interests. Students\nwill explore the state-of-the-art techniques and systems for\nprogram analysis. After taking the module, students will\nbe able to apply advanced automated program analysis\ntools and techniques to verify, test, and debug programs,\nas well as be better prepared for conducting research in\nprogram analysis and apply them in related research\nareas.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS3230 and CS4212","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"COM1-VCRM","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
