{"moduleCode":"YHU3325","title":"Advanced Latin: Catiline in the Roman Elite Imagination","description":"This course offers an opportunity to explore the mercurial figure of Catiline, the Roman aristocrat infamously implicated into conspiracies to overthrow the Republic between 65-63BC. This exploration is conducted via detailed analysis of a series of literary texts in the original Latin across a 40-year period, with particular attention paid to Cicero’s first speech against Catiline (In Catilinam 1), Sallust’s historiographical narrative in the Bellum Catilinae, and the image of Catiline on Aeneas’ shield in Virgil’s epic Aeneid. Students will be exposed to different literary genres that allow them to chart the development of ‘Catiline’ in the Roman elite imagination.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YLL2201 Intermediate Latin or with the permission of the instructor.","preclusion":"YLL3202 Advanced Latin: Catiline in the Roman Elite Imagination","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
