{"moduleCode":"LL5312V","title":"The Law of Global Governance","description":"The past two decades have witnessed the emergence of\nnew forms of international organizations (e.g. Basel\nCommittee) alongside traditional organizations (e.g. WTO).\nThese new organizations challenge the traditional premises\nof international law. Moreover, international organizations\nincreasingly issue rules that impact people around the world,\nyet they largely operate within a legal void and go\nunchecked. In view of these challenges, a new legal school\nof thought is emerging that seeks to set more legal\nconstraints and that introduces institutional reforms, such as\nthe growing inclusion of Asian countries in international\norganizations. We will explore these issues.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.\nBackground in Public International Law and/or Administrative\nLaw is an asset.","preclusion":"LL4312/LL5312/LL6312 The Law of Global Governance","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
