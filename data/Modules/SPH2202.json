{"moduleCode":"SPH2202","title":"Public Health Nutrition","description":"Public Health Nutrition lies at the intersection of public health and nutritional sciences and is concerned with the “promotion and maintenance of nutrition-related health and wellbeing of populations through the organized efforts and informed choices of society”. Such approaches are required to solve many of the complex nutritional challenges, such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, micronutrient deficiencies, and hunger, which we face today. In this class we will study fundamental concepts related to nutrition, understand frameworks used to examine public health issues, and examine key historical and current public health nutrition challenges and policies.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","preclusion":"SPH2104","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 6, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1830,"venue":"MD1-08-01E","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}]}]}
