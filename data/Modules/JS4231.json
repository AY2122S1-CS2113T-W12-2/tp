{"moduleCode":"JS4231","title":"Technologies and Traditional Japanese Theatre","description":"Technologies, from lighting to digital installation, play critical roles in theatre performance, while also an integral part of research and pedagogy. This module focuses on the roles of technologies in traditional Japanese theatre from premodern to contemporary times and from pre- to post-performance. We examine the roles of technologies in traditional Japanese theatre within and outside of Japan, and ask how can we make better use of technologies, both hardware and software, in learning more about traditional Japanese theatre. We will also learn to build digital resources on Japanese theatre as a practical way to engage with technologies.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Japanese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in JS or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in JS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS4-0118","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}]}]}
