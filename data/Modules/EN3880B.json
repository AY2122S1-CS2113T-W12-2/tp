{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"With particular focus on the works of Julian Barnes, JM Coetzee, William Boyd, and Don DeLillo, this module explores how these contemporary novelists get around the problem of the â€œdeath of the author,â€? surpassing even reader-response theory, and transforming narratives into a question of what we will call â€œreader responsibility.â€? Through analyses of DeLilloâ€™s Cosmopolis, Barnesâ€™s Sense of an Ending, Coetzeeâ€™s Childhood of Jesus, and Boydâ€™s Any Human Heart, this module examines how these novelists effectively make readers complicit with narrative developments.","title":"Reader-Responsibility","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"(i) EN1101E AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","corequisite":"So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EN3880B","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["EN1101E",{"or":["EN2201","EN2202","EN2203","EN2204","EN2205","EN2207","EN2275","EN2276","EN2277"]}]}}
