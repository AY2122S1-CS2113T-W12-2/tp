{"moduleCode":"GE3247","title":"Worlds of Work","description":"This module offers a work and labour-based perspective on the contemporary global economy, which is still predominantly studied from the viewpoint of firms and states in the social sciences. It profiles the vast range of work types and conditions that constitute the economy, and their wider societal implications. Moreover, it develops an explicitly geographical perspective, using the lenses of place, space and scale to reveal the inherent spatialities of worlds of work.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 25, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"LT14","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"DO2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"DO3","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"DO1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS2-0204","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}]}]}
