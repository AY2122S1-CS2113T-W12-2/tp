{"moduleCode":"YSS4267","title":"Religion-State Relations in Comparative Perspective","description":"Religion remains a force in the contemporary world keeping its hold not only on the private lives of individuals, but also tenaciously maintaining its presence in national, transnational and global politics. Yet, a marked feature of modern states is secularism, the assertion of (varying degrees of) separation of law from religion. The result of this contradiction is that contestations over religion-state relations remains a protracted feature of our increasingly religiously and ideologically polarized world. With specific reference to the idea of secularism and the right to religious freedom, this class will explore debates over religion-state relations in comparative contexts.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
