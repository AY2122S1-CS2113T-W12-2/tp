{"moduleCode":"PP5151","title":"Comparative Case Study Method","description":"Case studies are widely used in public policy analysis. But what assumptions do we rely on when we draw general lessons from specific policy events? What is the point of comparison and how can we do it fairly? This course examines what the systematic, close study of carefully chosen cases can teach us about political and policy processes. It will enable students to identify the major elements of comparative case studies as a research method, to consume published case studies in a critical manner, and to conduct an independent case study focused on public policy change.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
