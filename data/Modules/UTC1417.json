{"moduleCode":"UTC1417","title":"Jr Sem: Bioethics in the 21st Century","description":"Bio-medicine and biotechnology are rapidly progressing technologies in the 21st century. Who carries responsibility for debating the ethical use of these innovations – national committees, or everyday citizens? Debating bioethics requires some knowledge of three areas: bio-medicine and biotechnology themselves, theories of ethics, and methods of logical reasoning with regards to the ethical applications of the technologies to people at different stages of life. We will explore issues running from the beginning of human life (such as cloning), throughout life (such as biological enhancements) and at life’s end (such as the ethics of\nassisted death).","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","preclusion":"All other Junior Seminars.\nUTC14%","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2030,"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1630,"endTime":1930,"venue":"CAPT-SR3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}]}]}
