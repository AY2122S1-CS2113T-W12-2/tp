{"moduleCode":"UPI2213","title":"Making Sense of Colonial Ideology and Its Legacies","description":"The rule of Britain, France and the Netherlands in the 18th-20th centuries have left behind a conflicting legacy in different parts of Asia. On the one hand, they destroyed—even if only partially—the cultural traditions as well as socio-economic infrastructure of their colonies. On the other, they established political, economic, social and cultural institutions that colonialized subjects have to different degrees benefitted from till this day. This module will examine how this conflicting legacy came about, so that students will be more analytically equipped in making sense of it.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"UT-AUD2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"UT-AUD2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30}]}]}
