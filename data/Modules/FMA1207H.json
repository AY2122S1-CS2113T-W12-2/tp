{"moduleCode":"FMA1207H","title":"FS: Biopolitics","description":"How did the lives of human beings become objects of governance? Introduced by Michel Foucault in the 1970s, the concept of biopolitics has been one of the most critical tools in investigating the control and regulation of different levels of human life—from individual bodies to populations. Through examining the production and use of medical and scientific knowledge of human life in imperial, colonial, and national histories, this module explores historical processes in which human lives gradually came to be included in various practices of political power. Discussion topics include: race, gender/sexuality, public health and hygiene, population control, and eugenics.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"Other Freshman Seminar modules","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
