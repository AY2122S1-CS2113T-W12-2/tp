{"moduleCode":"PC3247","title":"Modern Optics","description":"The objective of this module is to establish the interconnectedness of knowledge between principles of optics and modern sciences/technologies and identify the applications in our daily life. It covers wave properties, refraction and dispersion, interference, Michelson interferometer, Fabry-Perot cavity and optical resonator, interference filter, Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction, resolution limit, Fourier transformation, holography; polarisation, birefringence and wave plates, light absorption and emission, lasers. This module is targeted at physics and non-physics students, who are interested in principles of modern optics.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC2131 or EE2005","preclusion":"PC2231","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Hybrid_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Hybrid_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35}]}]}
