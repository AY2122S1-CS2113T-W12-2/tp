{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course undertakes an in-depth study of the concept, value, and practices of solidarity in connection with social change. What different things are meant by â€œsolidarity,â€? and how do they motivate social change? Must solidarity be grounded in a shared social identity, e.g. race or gender? Do we have moral duties to stand in solidarity with others? What principles should govern solidary groups? Readings will include contemporary book-length treatments of these questions.","title":"Solidarity and Social Change","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0.5,9],"prerequisite":"YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 and YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 and at least one 3000 level Philosophy module or two 2000 level Philosophy modules or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU4256","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["YCC1113","YCC1114"]}}
