{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Chemical trace analysis is the use of analytical techniques to detect and/or quantify the presence of very low concentrations of substances. This is important in various industries, including for quality assurance, environmental monitoring, food and biomedical/pharmaceutical safety. Students will learn the principles, instrumentation and applications of trace analysis of both inorganic and organic contaminants, including: sample preparation, measurement methodologies, including isotope dilution, chemosensors and biosensors, matrix effects, sampling bias & statistical evaluation. Students will also receive practical training in trace analysis methodology and instrumentation.","title":"Trace Analysis","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,3,3],"prerequisite":"CM3242 or by Departmental approval","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM4241","attributes":{"mpes2":true,"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0314","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0314","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0314","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":80,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-05T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"CM3242"}
