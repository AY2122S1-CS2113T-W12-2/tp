{"moduleCode":"CM4241","title":"Trace Analysis","description":"Chemical trace analysis is the use of analytical techniques to detect and/or quantify the presence of very low concentrations of substances. This is important in various industries, including for quality assurance, environmental monitoring, food and biomedical/pharmaceutical safety. Students will learn the principles, instrumentation and applications of trace analysis of both inorganic and organic contaminants, including: sample preparation, measurement methodologies, including isotope dilution, chemosensors and biosensors, matrix effects, sampling bias \u0026 statistical evaluation. Students will also receive practical training in trace analysis methodology and instrumentation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM3242 or by Departmental approval","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S8-0314","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S8-0314","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S8-0314","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":80}]}]}
