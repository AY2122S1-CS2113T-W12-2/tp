{"moduleCode":"LL4037V","title":"Sociology of Law","description":"The sociology of law studies law as a social institution. We will explore the relationships among law, social actors and other social institutions. This is in contrast to the legal academy\u0027s formalist approaches that treat law as autonomous and impartial, and jurisprudential concerns about law\u0027s morality. We will consider both theoretical and empirical, and classic and contemporary works in sociology of law. Issues covered include: law and classic social theory; law and contemporary social theory; law and power; the social construction of disputes and dispute resolution; law and organizations; legal mobilization; law, collective action, and social change; legal consciousness; and, sociological perspectives on the legal profession.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"For Law Students: NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or its equivalent; For Non-Law Students: Open to students from Arts and Social Sciences with at least 80 MCs.","preclusion":"Students who are taking or have taken LL4037","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
