{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Karl Marx (1818–1883) was born into a world in revolt. The American (1776) and French (1789) Revolutions expanded the horizons of political activity, while the Industrial Revolution was reshaping the economy and environment. Marx, a journalist, activist, and theorist, lived through, commented on, and even took part in some of the most important developments in modern global history. We will study the development of his thought against this background, and assess it in philosophical terms: is Marx’s critique of capitalism a relic of its 19th century context? Or can it speak to our own rapidly transforming world?","title":"Karl Marx and the Age of Revolutions","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[1,3,0,0,8.5],"prerequisite":"Completion of all 1st year Common Curriculum modules and YCC2121 Modern Social Thought.
