{"moduleCode":"JS3216","title":"Japanese Film and Literature","description":"Many Japanese literary writings have been adapted into films, inevitably with new interpretations and perspectives. This module examines important Japanese literary writings, which are loosely defined to include all printed-texts, and their film adaptations. As a re-creation of the literary writings chosen from a variety of sources and traditions, the films that are produced from these literary works are studied as both related to and independent from the source texts. This module examines both the printed texts and visual texts to gain new perspectives on both texts as well as on Japan and Japanese culture.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Japanese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS6-0212","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":20}]}]}
