{"moduleCode":"CS6205","title":"Advanced Modelling \u0026 Simulation","description":"The aim of this course is to provide students with the ability to model, simulate and analyse complex systems in a reasonable time. This course is divided into three parts and covers advanced techniques in simulation model design, model execution, and model analysis. A selection of model design techniques such as conceptual models, declarative models, functional models, constraint models, and multi-models will be discussed. Model execution techniques include discussion of serial and parallel discrete-event simulation algorithms. For model analysis, topics include input-output analysis, variance reduction techniques and experimental design.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS3232 or CS4237","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
