{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The main objective is to examine and understand the role of formal education - i.e., in school - and education outside of school within contemporary societies. Besides presenting the classic major sociological theories of education, an array of case studies that elaborate on extra-curriculum education will also be presented. We will examine the relationship between education and nation building, the impact of schooling on social stratification, the functions and effects of education, the teaching of discipline through extra-curriculum educational activities, and the relationship between the educational system and the workplace. This course is mounted for all students with interest in the sociology of education.","title":"Sociology of Education","department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SC3204","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS1-0205","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0205","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"]}]}
