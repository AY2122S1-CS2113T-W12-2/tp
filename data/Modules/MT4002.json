{"moduleCode":"MT4002","title":"Technology Management Strategy","description":"The aim of this module is to help engineering students commercialize new products and services, which is key part of an engineer\u0027s career. Effective commercialization requires engineers to think about a product’s value proposition, customers, method of value capture, scope of activities, and method of strategic control, all of which can be defined as a “product’s strategy.” By providing good theory, examples, and cases, this module helps students understand these necessary aspects of commercialization and to the changes that are occurring in industry that facilitate commercialization. These changes include standards, vertical disintegration, open innovation, and open science.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
