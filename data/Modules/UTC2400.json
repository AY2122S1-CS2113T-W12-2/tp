It focuses on how ordinary individuals identify social needs in the local community and endeavour to improve the lives of vulnerable groups by\norganising grassroots solutions. These individuals include\nNobel Laureates such as Mother Teresa or Muhammad\nYunus but also ordinary unsung heroes closer to\nSingapore. Students are required to investigate the\nemergence of pioneering community leaders combining\nthe socio-historical contexts, personal psychology,\nnetworking and socialisation processes and social\nentrepreneurship. The teaching methodology incorporates\nlectures, seminar discussion, experiential exercises and\nfield study to interview real-life community leaders.","title":"Community Leadership","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[1,2,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC2400","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CAPT-SR1-2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CAPT-SR1-2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CAPT-SR1-2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"CAPT-SR1-2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
