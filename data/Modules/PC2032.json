{"moduleCode":"PC2032","title":"Classical Mechanics I","description":"This essential module for Physics majors gives a first look at and serves as a model for the mathematical treatment of all later Theoretical Physics modules. It assumes knowledge from H2 Mathematics (or the equivalent) and is intended for students who wish to acquire a deep understanding of our Mechanical Universe. It considers the principles of Newtonian Mechanics and covers topics such as kinematics, inertial and non-inertial reference frames, linear momentum, kinetic energy, and angular momentum; Newton\u0027s laws of motion, forces and torques; systems of many particles including rigid bodies; conservation laws; Newtonian gravity and Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"(PC1101 or PC1431) and H2 Mathematics/Further Mathematics or equivalent.","preclusion":"PC2412, PC2132","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 7, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"LT29","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT32","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]}]}
