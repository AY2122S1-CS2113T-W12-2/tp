It assumes knowledge from H2 Mathematics (or the equivalent) and is intended for students who wish to acquire a deep understanding of our Mechanical Universe. It considers the principles of Newtonian Mechanics and covers topics such as kinematics, inertial and non-inertial reference frames, linear momentum, kinetic energy, and angular momentum; Newton's laws of motion, forces and torques; systems of many particles including rigid bodies; conservation laws; Newtonian gravity and Keplerâ€™s laws of planetary motion.","title":"Classical Mechanics I","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,1,5],"prerequisite":"(PC1101 or PC1431) and H2 Mathematics/Further Mathematics or equivalent.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC2032","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT29","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT32","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-07T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["PC1101","PC1431"]}}
