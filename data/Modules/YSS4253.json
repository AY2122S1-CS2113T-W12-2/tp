{"moduleCode":"YSS4253","title":"Ethnography as Theory and Method: Classical and Contemporary Readings","description":"Anthropologists have long argued against the radical separation of theory and method. Not only does ethnographic observation shape the knowledge it produces; anthropology’s commitment to an intersubjective world determines the kind of embedded observation, “thick description” and “grounded theory” that are its stock-in-trade. But what are ethnography and grounded theory in our late modern world, when many of the humanist assumptions on which anthropology was founded have come under critique - feminist, Marxist, queer, and postcolonial? Drawing on ethnographies past and present, this class will explore these questions through a close engagement with ethnographic texts, past and present.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
