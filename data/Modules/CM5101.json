At the outset, students are required to select at least 4 specialized topics to focus on, from: (i) NMR spectroscopy, (ii) Mass spectrometry, (iii) Elemental and thermal analysis, (iv) Chromatography\nand hyphenated techniques, (v) Single crystal and powder X-ray crystallography, (vi) Scanning probe and microscopic techniques. Besides learning the scientific fundamentals through recorded lectures/seminars and\nonline assessments, students work directly with instrumental experts in the various laboratories to gain hands-on knowledge and practical aspects of each of these techniques.","title":"Advanced Analysis and Characterization Techniques","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,0,5,0,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM5101","semesterData":[]}
