{"moduleCode":"CM5101","title":"Advanced Analysis and Characterization Techniques","description":"This is an integral module providing comprehensive theory and practical training on various techniques needed in advanced chemical analysis and\ncharacterization. At the outset, students are required to select at least 4 specialized topics to focus on, from: (i) NMR spectroscopy, (ii) Mass spectrometry, (iii) Elemental and thermal analysis, (iv) Chromatography\nand hyphenated techniques, (v) Single crystal and powder X-ray crystallography, (vi) Scanning probe and microscopic techniques. Besides learning the scientific fundamentals through recorded lectures/seminars and\nonline assessments, students work directly with instrumental experts in the various laboratories to gain hands-on knowledge and practical aspects of each of these techniques.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","preclusion":"CM5201 – Practical Synthetic and Analytical Chemistry\n(this module has some analytical component similar to\nthe proposed module)","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
