{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Populism challenges liberal democracy around the world, upsetting domestic and international political order. Yet, despite its ubiquity, populism is a slippery phenomenon and can be difficult to define. In this course, we will examine populism from the perspectives of philosophy, politics, and economics. Among other things, we will examine definitions of what populism is and its relationship to liberal democracy; we will examine the causes of populism, such as free trade and economic inequality; we will examine the goals of various populist movements from around the world; and we will debate the legitimacy of policy responses to populism.","title":"Populism","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,1,8.5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3310","semesterData":[]}
