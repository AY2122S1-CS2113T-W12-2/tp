{"moduleCode":"BN2111","title":"Biomedical Engineering Principles and Practice II","description":"This module is the second of a set of two modules: Engineering Principle and Practice I and II (EPP I and EPP II). EPP modules aim to introduce first year students to the biomedical engineer’s way of thinking and addressing problems. A real-life medical technology will be used to demonstrate the fundamental knowledge and skills that a biomedical engineer is expected to possess. In EPP II, students will be exposed to key engineering problems such as how systems are controlled, powered and optimized.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"BN1102","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"W4","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"EA-06-02","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":80},{"classNo":"W2","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E5-03-20","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":80},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1100,"venue":"LT7A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":160},{"classNo":"W3","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"EA-02-11","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":80}]}]}
