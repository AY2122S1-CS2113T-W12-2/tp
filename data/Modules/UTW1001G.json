{"moduleCode":"UTW1001G","title":"Human Behaviours: How do \u0027I\u0027 fit in this Social World?","description":"Human behaviours are complex. Individuals’ intrapersonal and interpersonal social skills could affect how well they function in a society. This course will allow students to examine psychosocial and sociocognitive theories that explain intrapersonal and interpersonal social skills which are defined as 21st-century competencies. Students will evaluate the appropriateness/effectiveness of intrapersonal skills such as the self-concept/image, self-regulated learning and maintaining intellectual openness, and interpersonal skills such as team cooperation/collaboration, conflict management, and leadership in educational, political and business settings.  By the end of this module, students should be able to critically analyse and develop awareness of essential social behaviours and skills.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying English Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic Purposes modules.","preclusion":"Students who have already read a WP2201%, IEM1201%, ES1201G, ES1201L, UTW1001% or ES1501% module.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16}]}]}
