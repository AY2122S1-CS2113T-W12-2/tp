{"moduleCode":"GES1037","title":"A History of Singapore in Ten Objects","description":"This module facilitates an introductory inquiry into Singaporean pasts based on a cache of \u0027objects\u0027, broadly defined. Students will be invited to make critical\nobservations and bring to bear their imaginations on a variety of \u0027objects\u0027 from Singapore’s pasts: sand, well, club, movie and sound card, among others. Students will then exercise their historical imaginations to generate interpretive possibilities pertaining to Singapore\u0027s past prompted by these objects, both individually and collectively. In reflecting on these objects and their possible connections to the past, students will emerge from this module with a broad, diverse, creative and concrete grasp of Singapore\u0027s histories.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GESS1026","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 25, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E3","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS1-0208","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS4-0118","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS2-0311","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS8-0401","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}]}]}
