{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module aims to excite first year engineering students about Environmental Engineering and the science and engineering principles that underlie Environmental Engineering applications. The module equips students with knowledge, critical thinking, computer-aid analysis, and practical experiences that are fundamental to Environmental Engineering. Basic environmental chemistry, microbiology, and hydraulics will be examined through a project-based learning. Thus, students will learn basic principles of chemical and biological processes and will be exposed to the concept of hydraulics. The lab-style teaching provides opportunities for hands-on experiences in 3D model design, digitalization, big-data analysis, and system analysis for environmental pollution control.","title":"Environmental Engineering Principles and Practice","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2,0,3,3,2],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ESE2101","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"B02","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EW2-03-14","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"B01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"EW2-03-14","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
