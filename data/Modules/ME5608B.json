{"moduleCode":"ME5608B","title":"Hybrid Manufacturing","description":"This introductory module emphasizes on hybrid manufacturing techniques. This will focus on how to use two or more non-conventional material additive and removal processes in macro, micro and nano-scale to machine features. Topics include: bio-micro printing, chemicalmechanical polishing (CMP), electrical-chemical machining (ECM), ultra-precision diamond turning (UPDG), Electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID) grinding, laser-based machining, Ultrasonic Machining, Abrasive Machining Processes, etc. Students are expected to carry out an independent study by project or term paper on the related topics. A structured programme of lectures, term papers, and a final examination are included in this module.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"ME5608: Additive and Non-Conventional Manufacturing Processes","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 24, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":60,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20}]}]}
