{"moduleCode":"LL6233V","title":"European Company Law","description":"European company law can be understood in two ways. It can indicate the EU’s approach to company law and thereby lead to an analysis of the harmonized standards for 28 European nations. It can also be understood as a comparative approach to the different legal systems on the European continent.  \n\nThis course includes both aspects. It will first concentrate on EU legislation and jurisdiction, followed by a comparison of the legal systems of the two most important continental European jursidictions, France and Germany. It will lead to an understanding of shared principles of civil law jurisdictions and emphasize important differences to common law systems.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent.","preclusion":"Students who are taking or have taken LL6233.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
