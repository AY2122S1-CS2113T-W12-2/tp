{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module examines the Asian media industries in terms of their production, regulation, distribution, audiences and media genres as they undergo digital transformations and adapt to new audiences and markets. The media industries in Asia face particular challenges that are local, regional and global in nature in this phase of development. While it is not as mature as in Western countries, it is not a young industry either. These conditions are uniquely historical, political and cultural. Furthermore, it will examine how media, in return frame the conditions for engaging with social change including nation-building, development, globalisation and engagement with new international markets.","title":"Media in Asia","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"NMC5362","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],"venue":"AS6-0212","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
