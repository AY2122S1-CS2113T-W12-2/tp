{"moduleCode":"TS4219","title":"Media and Popular Performance","description":"This module examines popular media-mediated events \"as\" performance.  The module will investigate the way in which \u0027mediatised\u0027(i.e. media-mediated) and popular events \"perform\" and shape the audience\u0027s perception of reality.  Conversely, the module will also examine how media-mediated performance is influenced by audience interests and perceptions.  The focus will be on popular media-mediated events like sports, reality TV, the internet to illustrate how they constitute different modes of performances while sharing similar performativities.  The module will also focus on cross-genre, inter-disciplinary performances while also examining notions of the spectacular and spectacle in contemporary visual culture.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"AS5-0205","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25}]}]}
