{"moduleCode":"CE5509B","title":"Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Structures to EC4","description":"The primary objective of this module is to equip participants with sufficient design knowledge and skills on steel?concrete composite structures in their engineering career. This module provides participants with fundamental approaches in designing structural steel?concrete components and buildings. The participants will acquire fundamental knowledge and skills to perform structural design for composite beams, slabs, columns, joints, multi?storey buildings. This enables the participants to conceive a safe and economical structural system. The module is targeted at practicing engineers, post?graduate civil engineering students and those with a keen interest on structural design.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Background in Structural Steel Design","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":930,"endTime":1330,"venue":"LT1","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
