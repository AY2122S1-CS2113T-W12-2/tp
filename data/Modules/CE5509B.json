{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The primary objective of this module is to equip participants with sufficient design knowledge and skills on steelâ€?concrete composite structures in their engineering career. This module provides participants with fundamental approaches in designing structural steelâ€?concrete components and buildings. The participants will acquire fundamental knowledge and skills to perform structural design for composite beams, slabs, columns, joints, multiâ€?storey buildings. This enables the participants to conceive a safe and economical structural system. The module is targeted at practicing engineers, postâ€?graduate civil engineering students and those with a keen interest on structural design.","title":"Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Structures to EC4","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[1,0.5,0,0.5,3],"prerequisite":"Background in Structural Steel Design","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"CE5509B","attributes":{"lab":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0930","endTime":"1330","weeks":{"start":"2021-09-25","end":"2021-09-25"},"venue":"LT1","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":[4,5,6],"venue":"E1-06-07","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
