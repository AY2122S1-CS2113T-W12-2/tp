{"moduleCode":"BL5602","title":"Genetic Engineering in Biotechnology","description":"This module focuses on development of variable genetic engineering technologies in microorganisms, plants and animals as well as their applications in agriculture, medicine and environmental management. We will present popular examples of genetically modified organisms and discuss their impacts on biotechnology and society. This module will also cover the regulatory aspects of generation and marketing transgenic organisms, controversy and bioethics. We will also offer two simplified practical classes for students to have hand on experience to deliver genes into animal and plant cells and for observation of expression of foreign genes in transgenic organisms.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Any molecular biology modules.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Hybrid_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":33},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Hybrid_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":33}]}]}
