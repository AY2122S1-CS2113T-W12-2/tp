{"moduleCode":"BN6402","title":"Advanced Electrophysiology","description":"Electrophysiological disturbances have been linked to a variety of common diseases including neural, cardiac and gastrointestinal disorders. Computational models of electrophysiology have proven to be a valuable tool in gaining an insight into the pathophysiology of many diseases. In this module we will look in depth at the underlying basis for electrophysiology across a range of spatial scales and how these phenomena can be modelled computationally.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Graduate student standing","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
