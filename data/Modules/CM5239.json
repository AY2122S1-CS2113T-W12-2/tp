{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The aim of this module is to teach the basics of cheminformatics and the use computational techniques for chemical structure representation, data storage and analysis, as well as methods for predicting biological, chemical & physical properties and chemical/biological reactivity. Modern machine learning methods for processing and extracting useful information from multivariate data sets for both exploratory analysis will be introduced. In addition, applications of cheminformatics in drug discovery process, materials properties design, environmental science, and â€œin silicoâ€? predictive modelling will be discussed.","title":"Cheminformatics","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM5239","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT21","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-06T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
