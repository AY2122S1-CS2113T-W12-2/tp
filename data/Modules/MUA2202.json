{"moduleCode":"MUA2202","title":"Keyboard Literature II","description":"Keyboard Literature II explores the great composers and their greatest works for the piano, the music that forms the core repertory of contemporary conservatory curriculums and concert programs. Semester 2 slightly emphasizes music from the Romantic period, up to the present, but works from all periods will be covered. The repertoire of the modern professional pianist will be examined on the modern piano, as well as fortepianos and period pianos predating the modern piano, aiding in understanding of current and period performance practices. Non-Conservatory students that can read music may take this course as a free elective.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
