{"moduleCode":"UHB2208","title":"Immigration and the City","description":"In this course we will investigate and analyse key conceptual and theoretical ways of examining the relationships between immigration and the city through readings on migration processes and theories, the conceptualization of places such as immigrant enclaves, immigrant identity, immigrant  entrepreneurship, the \ngendered nature of some immigrant flows  and the mutual influence of immigrants and urban landscapes and cultures.  Readings in this seminar will draw from research by geographers, anthropologists, sociologists and economists.  We will learn how geographers conduct research and also conduct research on immigration and its effects in Singapore, using data available from archival \nsources, the Singapore government and information gathered by students.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules. \nUSP Advanced modules (Course-Based Modules, CBMs) may state general pre-requisite skills/knowledge.
