{"moduleCode":"UTC2720","title":"Income Inequality: A Teleological Perspective","description":"Many feel that the current level of income inequality is unfair and that capitalism is not functioning well for a vast majority of the population in several countries. Yet, some amount of inequality is inevitable as different people make different contributions in society. This begs the question: what is a fair level of inequality? This module synthesizes concepts from economics, political philosophy, game theory, information theory, systems engineering and statistical mechanics to provide a mathematical framework to analyse the income inequality problem and suggests options for tax policy, social programs and executive compensation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","preclusion":"UTC27%","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
