{"moduleCode":"RVSS1001","title":"Imagining Wakanda: Cities for work, life, and play","description":"The world stands at a pivotal time of intensifying urbanization and climate change. Grounded in the lived experience of Singapore’s urban spaces, this module adopts a critical approach to understanding the impact of these factors on cities. Students will understand the makings of a city, particularly in meeting the United Nation’s call of Sustainable Development Goal # 11 to “make cities and communities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.” With these insights, students will participate in envisaging liveable cities of the future as they become an increasingly important magnet for work, life, and play.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Ridge View Residential College","faculty":"Residential College","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
