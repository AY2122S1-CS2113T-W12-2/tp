{"moduleCode":"YHU3343","title":"Another World is Possible: Ecotopian Visions","description":"In the era of climate change, many scholars contend that we must develop alternatives to neoliberal fossil-fueled capitalism. This course explores visions of ecotopian futures that might guide our imaginations, beliefs, and actions by examining the ways that various authors, artists, thinkers, and communities have depicted alternative ‘green’ worlds, challenging dominant ideas about human nature, gender, nonhuman nature, culture, society, politics, and the future. With a diverse range of texts, from Björk and Hayao Miyazaki to Kim Stanley Robinson and Ursula K. Le Guin, we pair literature, film, music, art, and architecture with scholarship from environmental studies, history, anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","preclusion":"YID3203 Another World is Possible: Ecotopian Visions","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
