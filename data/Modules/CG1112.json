{"moduleCode":"CG1112","title":"Engineering Principles and Practice II","description":"This module will be for the students who have completed EPP I and the project scope extends to handle challenges in large-scale systems. Similar to EPP I, students will first learn the fundamental principles on certain advanced concepts and then design and programme a real-world system. The module involves designing a complex computer engineering system that facilitates information processing, real-world interfacing, and understanding the\neffects of certain useful metrics such as, scaling, safety, security, sustainability, societal impact, fault-tolerant design, etc.","moduleCredit":6.0,"department":"Computing and Engineering Programme","faculty":"Multi Disciplinary Programme","prerequisite":"CS1010 Programming Methodology and CG1111 Engineering Principles and Practice I","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
