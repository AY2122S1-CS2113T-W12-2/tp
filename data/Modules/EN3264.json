{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course provides an intensive introduction to key topics in postâ€?colonial theory through an overview of representative literary and theoretical texts. The syllabus demonstrates the vexed significance of the â€œpostâ€? in postâ€?colonial cultural traditions. In tracing how decolonization remains bound up with older, colonial forms of knowledge/power, we approach postâ€?coloniality as an aftermath. Through a range of writerly forms and cultural media, we identify the postâ€?colonial in the question of â€œtraditionâ€? and its centrality to â€œnonâ€?Westernâ€? modernity; in inscriptions of race/ethnicity/sexuality into Third World humanism; as the mourning for a vanishing past; as aesthetic resistance to homogenizing processes of modernization.","title":"In Other Wor(l)ds: Post â€?colonial Theory & Literature","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"(i) EN1101E AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","corequisite":"So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EN3264","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS1-0203","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["EN1101E",{"or":["EN2201","EN2202","EN2203","EN2204","EN2205","EN2207","EN2275","EN2276","EN2277"]}]}}
