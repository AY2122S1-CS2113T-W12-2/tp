This course will address questions such as: What is the Spanish legacy in Latin America? What issues have these countries dealt with over their recent history? How are these issues portrayed in their literature and films? What are the differences and commonalities across countries? Students will analyze and contextualize these works via in-class discussions and presentations on the history, traditions, and ideas embedded within them. This module will emphasize students\u0027 engagement with the ideas in the texts paying attention to stylistics, genre, and voice in their work.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YLS2202 Intermediate Spanish 2 or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
