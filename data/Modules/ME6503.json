{"moduleCode":"ME6503","title":"Theory of Transformations in Metals","description":"The module is designed for graduate students who study in the area of metallic materials. It deals with fundamentals of thermodynamics and kinetics related to metals. The course starts with introduction on thermodynamics followed by ideal and regular solutions. Different atomic mechanisms of diffusion will be discussed. The course will underline transformations from thermodynamics point of view. The following topics will be taught in this module: fundamentals of phase diagrams, chemical equilibrium, diffusion, interfaces, diffusional transformations, diffusionless transformations structure of liquid metals, nucleation and growth in liquid metals, solidification related structures and defects.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
