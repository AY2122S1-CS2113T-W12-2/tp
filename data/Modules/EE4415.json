{"moduleCode":"EE4415","title":"Integrated Digital Design","description":"This module introduces the students to the design of integrated circuits. It covers basic concepts including integrated circuits fabrication technology, CMOS and nMOS design, inverter design, aspect ratios of pull-up and pull-down transistors, switching characteristics of CMOS and nMOS inverters, latch-up, stick diagram, design rules, mask layout, sub-systems design, ASIC challenges and issues, ASIC design flow, Verilog hardware design language basics, and logic synthesis. Each student will do a design exercise using the EDA tools.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"EE2026 (for AY2017 intake \u0026 after) ; EE2020 (for AY2016 intake \u0026 prior)","preclusion":"EE4415E, TEE4415","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E5-03-21","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E5-03-21","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":40}]}]}
