{"moduleCode":"BL5225","title":"Marine Conservation","description":"The marine environment covers 70% of the earth\u0027s surface yet much of it remains unexplored.  It performs an important role in regulating global climate and supports a bewildering diversity of life.  Its resources are constantly being exploited by people and it suffers impacts from human activities.  Management is needed to sustain the goods and services provided by the marine environment, but has to be built on a proper understanding of its properties.  The module examines the dynamism of the marine environment, the biodiversity it harbours, its utilization by people, the impacts from human activity and various management systems and options.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Open to graduate students only","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
