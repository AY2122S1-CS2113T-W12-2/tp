{"moduleCode":"UTW1001E","title":"From Human to \u0027Posthuman\u0027","description":"This writing course considers the eternal question of what it is to be human in relation to the possibilities of transforming ourselves through genetic, neuro-cognitive or cybernetic technologies. How significantly would individuals, populations or the entire species have to be changed to warrant use of the term “posthuman” in describing them? How desirable would it be to transcend certain of our current limitations or to acquire wholly new capabilities?  In small interactive classes, students will explore these questions through critical examination of viewpoints expressed in both scholarly literature and imaginative media, ultimately developing their own positions in written arguments.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying English Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic Purposes modules.","preclusion":"Students who have already read a WP2201 or IEM module, ES1201G, ES1201L, ES1501% (namely ES1501A, ES1501B and ES1501C) modules.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16}]}]}
