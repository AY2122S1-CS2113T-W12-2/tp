{"moduleCode":"NM4254","title":"The City and Public Culture","description":"This module considers the city as a communicative assemblage that may be interpreted through the intersection of urban design and public culture perspectives. Taking Singapore as its primary site of investigation in comparison with other cities, it explores the ways by which culture, defined as “a contested and conflictual set of practices of representation bound up with the processes of formation and re-formation of social groups” (Frow and Morris, 2000, 328), is given expression through the curation of the city, whose material fabric and socio-spatial dimensions serve as arena for communication and contestation.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in NM, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"AS7-0119","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
