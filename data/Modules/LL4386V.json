{"moduleCode":"LL4386V","title":"Intellectual Property in Body, Persona \u0026 Art","description":"This course examines emerging trends to identify and analyse ways in which intellectual property laws are being used to commodify self. Through processes of intellectual propertisation, aspects of the human body, human persona, and human expression through art can be converted from ‘unowned’ to ‘owned’. Examining contemporary issues such as gene patents, fake news, authenticity and cultural appropriation, as well as emerging technologies such as transplanted and artificial body parts, cyborgs, mind downloads, blockchain and the Internet of Things, the course examines the mechanisms by which the expansion of intellectual property laws is enabling increasing commodification of humankind.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent; and successful completion of either Law of Intellectual Property [LL4405A/LL5405A/LC5405A/LL6405A;\n[LL4405B/LL5405B/LC5405B/LL6405B] or Foundations of Intellectual Property [LL4070/LL5070/LC5070/LL6070; LL4070V/LL5070V/LC5070V/LL6070V] (or their\nequivalent).","preclusion":"LL4386/LL5386/LL6386 Intellectual Property in Body, Persona \u0026 Art","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
