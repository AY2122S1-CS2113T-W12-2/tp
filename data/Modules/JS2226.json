{"moduleCode":"JS2226","title":"Global City Tokyo","description":"Tokyo is arguably the representative city of modern Japan. This module will examine how Tokyo copes with issues facing a modern metropolis, especially its response to the challenge of globalization. Moreover, by analyzing Tokyo\u0027s history of development, this module will discuss the extraordinary pace and intensity of urbanization as a result of globalization as well as common problems faced by \"global cities\" around the world. This module will be of particular interest to Singaporean students not only because of the close ties between Japan and Singapore but also because of the many comparisons that can be made between Tokyo and the city-state.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Japanese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
