{"moduleCode":"HY3223","title":"Technology and Culture in the Asia-Pacific","description":"This module will introduce Asian, European, and American material from the late nineteenth century to nearly the present day, concentrating on social and cultural themes such as industrialization, colonialism, science and race, technology and war, computers and global telecommunications and biotechnology and the human genome project. It will be taught as a series of cases illustrating important events and multiple themes. The proposition that modern science and technology have been \u0027socially constructed\u0027, reflecting political and cultural values as well as the state of nature, will be examined rather closely. Some theoretical material will leaven our otherwise empirical focus.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
