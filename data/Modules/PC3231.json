{"moduleCode":"PC3231","title":"Electricity \u0026 Magnetism II","description":"This is the sequel to PC2131 Electricity \u0026 Magnetism I, leading to the objective of understanding classical electrodynamics. Most of the examples presented require a certain degree of mathematical manipulation, as compared to a first course in electricity and magnetism. It covers the following topics: conservation laws, electromagnetic waves in vacuum and in matter, guided waves, the\npotential formulation, Lienard-Wiechert potentials, dipole radiation, radiation from point charges, special relativity, relativistic mechanics and relativistic electrodynamics.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC2131","preclusion":"ESP2104","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
