{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The Mexican Revolution, which concluded the decades-long dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz, represents the inaugural event of modern Mexico. Not only a political, but an artistic revolution, it witnesses a proliferation of new artistic movements and practices, encompassing fiction, drama, poetry, popular song, painting, photography and early film. This course focuses on the tumultuous years of the revolutionary process itself—roughly 1910 to 1920—as well as the subsequent two decades, when artists began to memorialize and interrogate the recent past in divergent ways. Themes include: committed literature, utopianism and disillusionment, the new national identity, multiculturalism, social justice, and memorialization.","title":"Mexican Revolutionary Aesthetics","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,2.5,7],"prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
