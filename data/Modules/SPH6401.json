{"moduleCode":"SPH6401","title":"Advanced approaches in physical activity research","description":"Being active and less sedentary are cornerstones of\npopulation health. In this module we will examine\nfundamental concepts of physical activity and sedentary\nbehaviour, their relationship with health and highlight\nmultiple ways to change these behaviours. Students will\ngain advanced knowledge and skills in measuring physical\nactivity and sedentary behaviour, determining contextual\nfactors influencing these behaviours, and in the design of\nbehavioural interventions. Concepts related to scale-up\nwill also be discussed. The module has an emphasis on\nmodern digital technologies, including wearables and\nsmartphones. We will explore ways to utilize these\ntechnologies in the context of the stated objectives.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","prerequisite":"SPH5002 Public Health Research Methods","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
