{"moduleCode":"LL5387V","title":"Regulation of Digital Platforms","description":"This course will survey multiple legal fields that involve the regulation of what are generally referred to as “digital platforms,” including Google, Facebook, and others. The primary legal fields of study will be competition (antitrust) law and liability for third-party content. Because these areas of law draw heavily from economic theory and research, the course will also survey some of the relevant economics literature as a means of better understanding the relevant markets.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"LL4387/LL5387/LL6387 Regulation of Digital Platforms","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
