{"moduleCode":"ME3261","title":"Computer-Aided Design And Manufacturing","description":"This course covers the principles of computer-aided tools: CAD and CAM, which are widely used in modern design and manufacturing industry. By introducing the mathematical background and fundamental part programming of CAD/CAM, this course provides the basics for students to understand the techniques and their industrial applications. The topics are: CAD: geometric modelling methods for curves, surfaces, and solids; CAM: part fabrication by CNC machining based on given geometric model; Basics of CNC machining; Tool path generation in CAD/CAM (Option to introduce a CAM software to generate a CNC program for the machining of a part); Verification of fabricated part by CNC measurement based on given geometric model. The module is targeted at students specializing in manufacturing engineering.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","corequisite":"ME2162/ME3162","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 25, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}]}]}
