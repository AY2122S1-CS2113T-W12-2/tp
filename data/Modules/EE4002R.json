{"moduleCode":"EE4002R","title":"Research Capstone","description":"This research capstone project provides students with an opportunity to work on a complex engineering problem with a strong element of investigative and exploratory research.    It requires   a   confluence   of   knowledge,   skills   and capabilities  in  project  management  and  communications. The project will involve a varied blend of research, design and  development  activities  and is  carried  out  over  two semesters. The project proposal can come from a faculty member  or  student.  It  may  arise  during  the  student’s industrial  attachment  or  as  part  of  an  on-going  research project  and  may  involve  direct  industrial  and  research institutes’  participation.  Students  will  be  assessed individually.","moduleCredit":8.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Level 4 standing","preclusion":"EE4001, EG4301, CG4001","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]},{"semester":3,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]},{"semester":4,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
