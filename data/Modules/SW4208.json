{"moduleCode":"SW4208","title":"Social Gerontology","description":"This module examines the physiological, psychological, socio-cultural contexts of ageing and the attendant implications for individuals, families, and societies. Macro issues such as the impact of longer life expectancy, a greying workforce, and \u0027feminization of ageing\u0027 would be brainstormed in a seminar style of teaching. Social policies, social interventions and the impact of economic and social contexts on the well being of older people would increase the students\u0027 awareness and understanding of gerontological issues. Through interactive teaching, the students will learn about the theories of ageing and social policy issues such as income security, health care, housing, and leisure activities.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Social Work","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before:\nCompleted 80MCs, including 28MCs in SW of which (i) student must have passed SW1101E, SW2101, SW2104, SW2105, and SW3103A with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards:\nCompleted 80MCs, including 28MCs in SW of which (i) student must have passed SW1101E, SW2101, SW2104, SW2105, and SW3103B with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS1-0201","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
