It builds upon the skill sets that RC4 students acquired in junior seminar and senior seminar 1. Students will do individual projects supervised by RC4 fellows; some of them may involve external collaborations, and field work. Intellectual exchanges between supervisors, collaborators, practitioners on the field, and peers will provide a unique experience to students.","title":"Projects in Systems Thinking and System Dynamics","department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[2,0,0,4,4],"prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC2704","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR4","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":2,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":4,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR4","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":2,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR4","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":2,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["GEM1918","GEM1919","UTC1700","UTC1701","UTC1702"]}}
