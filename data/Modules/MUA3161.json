{"moduleCode":"MUA3161","title":"Junior Recital","description":"Focused study on an instrument forms the central pillar for\nthe BMus Majors in piano, strings, brass, wind and\npercussion. Normally undertaken in the third year of study,\nthis module forms an initial capstone for instrumental\nMajors on the BMus programme, serving otherwise as the\nfinal capstone for those undertaking instrumental studies\nas a second major. The module continues and\nconsolidates processes initiated in previous semesters,\nmanifesting their outcome in a shorter professional level\nperformance of approximately half an hour’s duration\n(usually either a recital and piano-accompanied concerto\nperformance). The performance should demonstrate the\nemerging professional capacities of each student.","moduleCredit":6.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"MUA2162","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
