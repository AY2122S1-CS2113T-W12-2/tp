{"moduleCode":"JS2214","title":"Ideas and Images in Japanese Culture","description":"Images are as important as ideas in defining and transmitting cultural patterns, and neither can be understood without exploring the other. This module attempts to look into the core of Japanese culture to understand the ideas that have been used to define Japanese culture and the connections these ideas have with images. Topics covered include Japanese aesthetic ideals, ethical paradigms, festivals, and visual arts. Through project work students will be encouraged to engage themselves creatively in exploring a specific aspect of Japanese culture, art, aesthetics or design that they find interesting.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Japanese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
