{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Military history is one of the most dynamic fields in the subject, focal point for controversies ranging from what historians should be studying to how they should see history per se. The traditional focus on operations, command and strategy now co-exists with the no longer ?new? military history that is more interested in the impact of warfare on society and culture, militarism and its effect on politics, the relationship between military institutions and economies, and issues of race and nationality in the military experience. This module will introduce graduate students to the methodologies and controversies of a field that crosses all regional and national boundaries in history. An important component will be the bibliographical project, training students to develop their own grasp of the literature that must be mastered.","title":"Approaches to Military History","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"HY5302","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS1-0303","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
