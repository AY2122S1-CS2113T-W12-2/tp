{"moduleCode":"FST5301A","title":"Scientific Principles of Nutraceuticals","description":"This module introduces oxidative stress and chronic inflammation as causative factors of chronic diseases in the context of how food constituents may act as dietary antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in mitigating the negative effects of oxidative stress and inflammation on development of chronic diseases such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and ageing. It discusses the chemical and biological mechanisms of the phytochemicals underpin their purported health promotion effects. It analyses the scopes and limitations of various research methods applied for establishment of scientific evidence as well as the global regulatory policies for health claims of functional foods.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Food Science and Technology","faculty":"Science","preclusion":"FST5301","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Dec 2, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":2000,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":90},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90}]}]}
