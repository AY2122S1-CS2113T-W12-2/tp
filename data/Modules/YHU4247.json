{"moduleCode":"YHU4247","title":"Museums and Libraries as Cultural Institutions","description":"Why do we preserve and construct the past? And how do we do it? Museums and libraries are the institutional brains of culture—they collect, store, and display the knowledge and artefacts of world—the sum of the human intellect and imagination. We will examine the histories and sometimes destruction of these two cultural institutions. Our approach will be both historical and theoretical in considering constructions of the universal/global and local/particular, things and ideas, the continuous dialogue between past and present and future. Course includes fieldtrips to the National Library of Singapore and the National Gallery of Singapore.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2 and at least one 3000 level History or Literature module or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
