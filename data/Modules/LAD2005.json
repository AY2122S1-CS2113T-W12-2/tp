{"moduleCode":"LAD2005","title":"Introductory GIS for Landscape Architecture","description":"This module provides an understanding of the basic concepts and uses of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology and spatial analysis. GIS is a combination of software and hardware with capabilities for manipulating, analyzing and displaying spatially-referenced information-information which is referenced by its location on the earth\u0027s surface. By linking data to maps, GIS reveals relationships not apparent with traditional item-referenced information systems and database management products, and by displaying information in a graphic form, it unpacks complex spatial patterns. The course emphasizes the concepts needed to use GIS correctly and effectively for manipulating, querying, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"SDE1-CL3","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
