{"moduleCode":"GET1034","title":"Communication and Critical Thinking for Community Leadership","description":"This critical thinking and communication module provides an opportunity for students to explore community leadership within an interdisciplinary environment. In particular, through understanding the constructivist theory of communication (Burleson, 2007) and Paul and Elder’s (2014) critical thinking framework, this module will facilitate the development of deliberative and active citizenry among students, regardless of the position they hold in the community. Students will apply these concepts individually to short case studies and reflections. They will then use these short assignments to conceptualize team projects relevant to their respective community settings.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","preclusion":"GEX1017","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"G04","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"RH-CONF-RM","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"G01","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"KEVII-MR2","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"G02","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"EH-SR1","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"G03","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"KRH-SR3","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15}]}]}
