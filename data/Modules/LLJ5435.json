{"moduleCode":"LLJ5435","title":"Foundations of Environmental Law","description":"Environmental Law is unique because it did not emerge from a single source of law. Rather, it has roots in almost every type of law. Through diverse readings, deep discussions, and independent research, this course will identify and understand the various types of law that, together, give rise to “environmental law.” The course will consider environmental law’s roots in common law, regulation, legislation, constitutions, international cooperation, public action, and even private self-governance. Though not exclusively, the focus will be on common law jurisdictions in the British tradition, but independent research will allow students to explore more widely for themselves.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"LL4435V/LL5435V/LL6435V Foundations of Environmental Law","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
