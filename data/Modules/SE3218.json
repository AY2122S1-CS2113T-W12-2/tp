{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"SE2215","description":"Industrialisation involves the promotion and development of the industrial sector. Why have some countries industrialised faster than others? In particular, the manufacturing industries in some countries have remained backward and depended heavily on the use of labour while in other countries, they have become more advanced and relied more on the use of capital. This module discusses the theory and concepts that relate to industrialisation. It also investigates the industrial experiences of other countries and the lessons from them. Focus will be on Singapore, and how it compares with other SE Asian countries.","title":"Industrialising Singapore and SE Asia","department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SE3218","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
