{"moduleCode":"MDG5242","title":"Advances in Microscopy and Chemical\nMicroanatomy","description":"This module develops the foundations of microscopy and\nchemical microanatomy essential for research and clinical\napplications. It covers the visualization of biomolecules in\ntissues and cells, including nuclei acids, proteins, lipids,\nmetabolites, inorganic materials and elements, in the fixed\nand living state, and in the context of human microscopic\nanatomy. Students will be introduced to different\nmicroscopy techniques with emphasis on structure-function\nrelationships, and shown examples of how these can be\napplied to solve problems in biomedical sciences. Suitable\nclinical problems will be introduced throughout the course\nto show the application of scientific knowledge, and to\nintegrate across disciplines.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"NUS Medicine Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
