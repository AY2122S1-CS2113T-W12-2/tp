{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course explores the dynamic role of non-state actors and how they interact with more established major players in global affairs (states and intergovernmental organizations). It focuses on civil society organizations and the business sector as two major categories of non-state actors. Core questions include: When and how do non-state actors matter? What are the sources of their influence? What kind of strategies do they use to achieve their goals? What are normative implications of the growing influence of these new actors? And how should the study of IR respond to this relatively new phenomenon?","title":"Non-State Actors in Global Affairs","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,1,8.5],"corequisite":"YSS2202 International Relations or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS4268","semesterData":[]}
