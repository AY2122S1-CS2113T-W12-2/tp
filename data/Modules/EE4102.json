{"moduleCode":"EE4102","title":"Digital Communications","description":"This course begins with the review of mathematical preliminaries such as probability, random process and signal space concepts. It covers the design of modulation and optimum demodulation methods for digital communications over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. Emphasis will be placed on error rate performance for the various digital signaling techniques (ASK, BPSK, FSK, MPSK, QAM, OQPSK, CPM, MSK and GMSK) and on the channel bandwidth requirements. Subsequently, the course will focus on channel coding (Block codes and Convolutional codes), channel equalization and carrier, symbol synchronization.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"EE3103","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
