{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The module introduces different modes of human robot interactions, methods for detecting humans, understanding human behaviors and intentions, and methods for humanrobot coordination and collaboration. Human-robot interactions include physical and non-physical (e.g. social) interactions. Physical interactions include human assistance and wearable robotics. Non-physical interactions include natural language understanding, spoken dialogue, gestures and â€œbody languageâ€?, and multimodal interaction fusing different interaction modalities. Human-robot coordination and collaboration include human-robot handovers, robotic assistants and coworkers. User interface design for mutual communications between robot and humans is covered, including social interaction. Several applications and scenarios will be included.","title":"Human-Robot Interaction","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,0.5,0.5,2,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EE4705","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT3","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":80,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT4","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":80,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
