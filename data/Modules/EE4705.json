{"moduleCode":"EE4705","title":"Human-Robot Interaction","description":"The module introduces different modes of human robot interactions, methods for detecting humans, understanding human behaviors and intentions, and methods for humanrobot coordination and collaboration. Human-robot interactions include physical and non-physical (e.g. social) interactions. Physical interactions include human assistance and wearable robotics. Non-physical interactions include natural language understanding, spoken dialogue, gestures and “body language”, and multimodal interaction fusing different interaction modalities. Human-robot coordination and collaboration include human-robot handovers, robotic assistants and coworkers. User interface design for mutual communications between robot and humans is covered, including social interaction. Several applications and scenarios will be included.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"LT3","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":80},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT4","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":80}]}]}
