{"moduleCode":"ESP3201","title":"Machine Learning in Robotics and Engineering","description":"Students will learn to create robots that are able to perform appropriate actions after receiving observations from the environment in the face of uncertainty. They will learn recursive state estimation, Kalman filtering, particle filtering and understand robot motion and measurement uncertainties. As robotics and vision serve similar goals, students will also learn computer vision techniques with machine learning to perform vision tasks. They will learn feature extraction in images, dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis, Non-parametric learning methods, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. The students will apply their learnt knowledge on a robotic task that involves both localization and vision.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Engineering Science Programme","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CS1010E \u0026 (ESP2110 or ME2142 or EE3331C)","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_E","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1100,"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1100,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":50}]}]}
