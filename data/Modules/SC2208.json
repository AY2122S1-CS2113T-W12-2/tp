{"moduleCode":"SC2208","title":"Baby or No Baby: Population Dynamics at a Crossroads","description":"Why are Singaporeans having fewer babies? Why is Japan\u0027s population shrinking? Population dynamics affects our daily lives. This course aims to provide students with a critical overview of the key issues in demography with a focus on Asia. We adopt an international perspective to think about ways in which populations grow, shrink, and change over time, and uncover the linkages between seemingly distinct demographic processes. Fertility is a fundamental issue underlying many demographic processes - population growth, aging, migration and demographic dividend, and will be discussed in detail. This module also covers health and mortality, gender and marriage, and urbanization.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 6, 2022, 2:30:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS7-0119","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS7-0119","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS1-0207","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
