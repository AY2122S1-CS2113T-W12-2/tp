{"moduleCode":"BMA5536","title":"Behavioral Economics in Business","description":"Behavioral Economics combines economic and psychological principles to explain economic behaviors that violate the rationality assumption and deviate from standard prediction. There are two streams of works in Behavioral Economics: Behavioral Decision Theory (BDT) and Behavioral Game Theory (BGT). BDT explains inconsistent choice behaviors in individual decision making. BGT explains boundedly rational actions in strategic decision making. \n\nThe goal of the course is to equip students with the theory and framework to understand the inconsistent choices and boundedly rational actions observed in experiments, to identify inconsistency in real life choices and actions, and to design nudges for behavioral change.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"There is no specific course pre-requisite.
