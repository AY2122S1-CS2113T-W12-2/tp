{"moduleCode":"CM4242","title":"Advanced Analytical Techniques","description":"Advanced mass spectrometric methods, and scanning probe microscopies form an important group of advanced analytical techniques widely used for research \u0026 development, and also for process/product control in advanced manufacturing industries. Microfluidics \u0026 labchip techniques, in particular, are increasingly used for biochemical assays in biomedical devices. Students will learn the principles, instrumentation and applications of these techniques, and receive in-depth training in selected advanced analytical techniques, including advanced mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM3242 or by Departmental approval","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1100,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}]}]}
