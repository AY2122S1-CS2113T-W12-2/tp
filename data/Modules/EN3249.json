{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module offers an introduction to the study of art, film and media culture. It explores the changing role of visual media across the centuries, from preâ€?modern societies through to todayâ€™s digital, networked cultures. How have technological and economic changes generated new visual media? How have these media in turn shaped social and economic life? A range of case studies will be drawn from art history, film, popular culture and online media. What are the differences between art, film and other visual culture, and are these differences still relevant in the â€˜convergentâ€™ world of digital media culture?","title":"Introduction to Visual Culture: Art, Film and Media","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"(i) EN1101E AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","corequisite":"So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EN3249","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS5-0202","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS5-0202","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["Unknown","B"]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["EN1101E",{"or":["EN2201","EN2202","EN2203","EN2204","EN2205","EN2207","EN2275","EN2276","EN2277"]}]}}
