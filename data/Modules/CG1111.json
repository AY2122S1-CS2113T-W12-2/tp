{"moduleCode":"CG1111","title":"Engineering Principles and Practice I","description":"This module aims to equip first year engineering students to a computer engineer\u0027s way of thinking and will focus on the engineering principles of how computer-aided systems work and fail and the engineering practice of how they are designed, built and valued. Students will be presented a practical computer engineering system, e.g., a sensorassisted autonomous vehicle, a drone, or an engineering event. They are then guided to reconstruct the system via\ninterconnected subsystems through laboratory sessions and group discussions, to explain using engineering principles how the system works and could fail.","moduleCredit":6.0,"department":"Computing and Engineering Programme","faculty":"Multi Disciplinary Programme","preclusion":"CG1108 Electrical Engineering, EG1112 Engineering Principles and Practice II","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
