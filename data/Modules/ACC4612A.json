It does this by reviewing and recommending processes for better governance and accountability. This includes giving assurance that polices and procedures are in place to ensure the organisation’s objectives are achieved, risks are managed, controls are complied with, and resources are used efficiently and economically. This module provides students with the knowledge, both theory and practice, of how internal audits are done to achieve these objectives.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Accounting","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"ACC3603 Assurance and Attestation; and\nACC3616 Corporate Governance and Risk Management \n\nOR\n\nACC3603 Assurance and Attestation,\nACC3611 Corporate Governance and Ethics;  and\nACC3612 Risk Management and Internal Control","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"A1","startTime":830,"endTime":1130,"venue":"BIZ2-0509","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"A1","startTime":830,"endTime":1130,"venue":"BIZ1-0206","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":50},{"classNo":"A1","startTime":830,"endTime":1130,"venue":"BIZ2-0413A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":50}]}]}
