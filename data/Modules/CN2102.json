{"moduleCode":"CN2102","title":"Chemical Engineering Principles and Practice II","description":"This module is the second part of a two-part module designed to provide first year Chemical and\nBiomolecular Engineering students with an experiential exposure to the foundational concepts of Biomolecular/Biochemical/Bioprocess Engineering, including mass and energy balances, biosafety and\nsterile handling, bioreaction kinetics, bioreactor design, downstream processing and purification, etc.,\nthrough a series of hands-on experimental laboratories. In the laboratory, they will learn to carry out\nmeasurement, data collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation. The laboratory sessions will be\nblended with real engineering applications of industrial and societal relevance to Singapore.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"CN1102","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT6","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":300},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"M2","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"M3","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"M1","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"T1","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"T2","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"TH1","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"TH2","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"TH3","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"W2","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"W3","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"T3","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20}]}]}
