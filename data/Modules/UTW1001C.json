{"moduleCode":"UTW1001C","title":"At the Edges of the Law: Ethics, Morality and Society","description":"What should be the reach of the arms of the law? Most find it unproblematic if a state punishes distributors of child pornography; but what if the punitive muscle of the state is also used to enforce public morality? Can the law intrude on the private lives of citizens? Should euthanasia be legal? In this module we shall be putting these and other pressing issues that are at the centre of political debate to critical enquiry. This module will appeal to students interested in the study of applied ethics, the criminal law, public policy and socio-political theory.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying English Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic Purposes modules","preclusion":"Students who have already read a IEM1201%, UTW1001% and ES1501 module.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"CAPT-SR4","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"RC4-SR5","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"CAPT-SR4","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"RC4-SR5","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"RC4-SR5","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"RC4-SR5","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15}]}]}
