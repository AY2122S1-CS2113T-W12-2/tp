We address, amongst others, personal characteristics related to work motivation (e.g., needs, attitudes, emotions, cognitions), job characteristics related to work motivation (e.g., autonomy, challenge), situational characteristics related to work motivation (e.g., social support, organizational justice, reward and punishment), and the consequences that follow for employee’s work behaviours.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Management and Organisation","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
