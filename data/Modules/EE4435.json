{"moduleCode":"EE4435","title":"Modern Transistors and Memory Devices","description":"This module is designed to equip students with the physical foundation of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) device physics and the theoretical background for understanding end applications in modern transistors and memory devices (e.g., Flash, phase change random access memory, etc.). Upon the successful completion of\nthis module, the student is expected to gain an understanding on the principles of operation and physics of modern MOS transistors and memory devices. Such knowledge is useful for careers in the wafer fabrication plants, foundries, design houses and the microelectronics industry.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CG2027/EE2027 and co-req EE3431C (for AY2017 intake \u0026 after) ; Pre-req EE2021 and co-req EE3431C (for AY2016 intake \u0026 prior)","preclusion":"TEE4435, EE4435E","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 29, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Packaged Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Packaged Tutorial","size":40}]}]}
