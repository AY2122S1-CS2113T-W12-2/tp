{"moduleCode":"USP2202","title":"Power, Identity, and Citizenship in Democratic Athens","description":"In this module, students will examine how the people of democratic Athens expressed their power, identity, and civic values through literature, visual art, and public architecture. In class, we will discuss both primary texts and secondary literature that shed light on how 5th and 4th century BCE Athenians represented themselves and their society. In Athens, we will visit key sites closely associated with democracy, study works of arts and monuments that reflect or contest its civic ideology, and meet with students at the University of Athens to discuss the contemporary legacy of ancient Athenian democracy.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
