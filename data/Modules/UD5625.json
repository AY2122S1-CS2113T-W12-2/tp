Topics cover three major methodology clusters â€“ spatial analytics based on geographic information science (GIS), qualitative research methods and participative design techniques. The spatial analytic part contains fundamental skills including thematic mapping, vector analysis tools, spatial analysis and network analysis. Qualitative part covers overview, survey and interview, but mainly focuses on field study. Participation content reviews the basic knowledge of community involvement. The subject is delivered through lectures, lab tutorials and projects. Hands-on lab tutorials and assignments provide students with experiences on selected key methods using real datasets; and exposure in local data environment and contexts.","title":"Methods and Tools for Urban Design","department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","workload":[2,2,0,2,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UD5625","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2300","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
