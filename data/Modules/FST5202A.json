{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"FST5202","description":"This module provides coverage of modern food fermentation relative to traditional fermented foods. Particular emphasis is placed on the microbiology and biochemistry of spontaneous and induced fermentation, physiology and metabolism of lactic acid bacteria, bacillus and other food bacteria, probiotics, yeasts and moulds, using selected fermented foods as case studies. Major topics include beneficial microorganisms and starter cultures of selected fermented foods, chemistry and flavour of selected fermented foods, nutritional enhancemement and food safety improvement, alcoholic and non-alcoholic fermentations by yeasts, lactic acid bacterial fermentations and fungal fermentations.","title":"Modern Food Fermentation","department":"Food Science and Technology","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,1,0,5,2],"prerequisite":"FST 3101 Food Enzymology and Fermentation, or LSM 3232 Microbiology, or by permission","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"FST5202A","attributes":{"mpes2":true,"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"2000","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT33","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":90,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT33","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-06T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
