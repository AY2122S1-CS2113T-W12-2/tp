{"moduleCode":"SE2210","title":"Popular Culture in Southeast Asia","description":"Popular culture - in forms such as music, cinema and magazines - has been seen as a way for non-elite groups to make sense of their common experiences. In the modern era, these pop culture products have also been linked with mass-production and standardised, commercialised commodities which work to entertain and distract. However, more recent scholarship has seen popular culture as a possible means of contesting dominant ideologies. This module examines the debate by considering various forms of popular culture in Southeast Asia.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"SE4215","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
