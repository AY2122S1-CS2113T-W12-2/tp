{"moduleCode":"AR2328","title":"Architectural Construction \u0026 Tectonics","description":"The module introduces the basic principles of construction in architecture by examining the physical properties of materials and its relationship with fabrication techniques \u0026 technology. Building components are presented as integrated systems. Tectonics is discussed as an expressive quality of architecture \u0026 structure, achieved by materials, construction and integration of building components. The module also addresses sustainability by considering the choice of materials, construction methods or strategies, waste management and life cycle thinking.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"9","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"SDE1-SR2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"8","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"SDE1-SR3","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"6","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"SDE1-SR5-6","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"7","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"SDE2-ER1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"UTSRC-LT50","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}]}]}
