{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The module introduces the basic principles of construction in architecture by examining the physical properties of materials and its relationship with fabrication techniques & technology. Building components are presented as integrated systems. Tectonics is discussed as an expressive quality of architecture & structure, achieved by materials, construction and integration of building components. The module also addresses sustainability by considering the choice of materials, construction methods or strategies, waste management and life cycle thinking.","title":"Architectural Construction & Tectonics","department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","workload":[2,2,0,2,6],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"AR2328","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"9","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SDE1-SR2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"8","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SDE1-SR3","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"6","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SDE1-SR5-6","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"7","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"SDE2-ER1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UTSRC-LT50","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["Unknown","B"]}]}
