{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This class studies the economics of cities and urban problems by understanding the effects of geographic location on the decisions of individuals and firms. Traditional microeconomic models are typically spaceless, yet location and distance plays an increasingly important part in modern economics. We will study questions such as Why do cities exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? We will analyze the economic problems that arise as people and firms cluster in cities. We will also discuss specific urban economic problems such as firm location, crime, transportation, housing, education, and local government economics.","title":"Urban Economics","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,4.5,5],"prerequisite":"YSS2203 Intermediate Microeconomics, YSS2211 Econometrics, or YSS3231 Methods in the Social Sciences, or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3265","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["YSS2203","YSS2211","YSS3231"]}}
