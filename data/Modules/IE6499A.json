{"moduleCode":"IE6499A","title":"Adv Topics in SE: Metaheuristic \u0026 Surrogate Optimization","description":"This course describes a variety of Metaheuristic search methods including simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms, dynamically dimensioned search, particle swarm, differential evolution and multi-objective methods. The course also describes the use of sophisticated surrogate optimization algorithms for\ncomputationally expensive functions (including objective functions that are computed from a complex computer code.) The algorithms can be used to find values of discrete and/or continuous variables that optimize system performance, improve model forecast ability, and improve system reliability. All methods search for the global optimium and are derivative-free.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Civil \u0026 Environmental Engineering / Industrial \u0026 Systems Engineering PhD-student standing (and students with no statistics background will need to do some extra reading)","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
