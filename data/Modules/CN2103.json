{"moduleCode":"CN2103","title":"Mass and Energy Balance","description":"This module provides students with basic concepts of material and energy balances in chemical engineering processes. It also gives a comprehensive introduction to different analytical and problem solving methods. In particular, steady state material and energy balances, including recycles, phase changes and reactions, form the core structure of the module. Other topics include simultaneous material and energy balances, unsteady state balances and the introduction and application of Mat lab in solving balance problems. All fundamental concepts are amply illustrated with relevant process examples. This module is targeted at level one or two engineering and science students.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"CN2101","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
