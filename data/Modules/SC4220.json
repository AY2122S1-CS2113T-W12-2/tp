{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module explores the intersection of aging and health within social contexts. This course first introduces the theoretical orientations focusing on social construction of aging and health. It considers distribution of illness among older adults and its association with demographic characteristics and SES. Next, this module examines the role of social contexts, including marital and family relationships, social networks, and social participation, on health disparities in late life. Finally, it examines how demographic characteristics, social contexts, and health are dynamically associated across the life course, focusing on gender differences.","title":"Aging and Health","department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"SC4220","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":55,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
