{"moduleCode":"MLE5213","title":"Magnetic Materials","description":"This module provides a foundation for students interested in\ndoing research into magnetic materials The module focuses\non a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of\nmagnetism and magnetic materials, integrating the physics\nand engineering applications. It is intended for advanced\nMSE undergraduates and MSE postgraduates who do not\nhave previous training in this area. Topics covered in this\nmodule are magnetostatics, magnetism of electrons,\nmagnetism of localized electrons on the atom,\nferromagnetism and exchange, antiferromagnetism,\nmicromagnetism, domains and hysteresis, nanoscale\nmagnetism, selected topics of current advanced magnetic\nmaterials. The module will finish with aspects of current\nresearch on magnetic materials.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"MLE4209 Magnetism and Magnetic Materials","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 30, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1700,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":180},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":180}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1700,"venue":"LT1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1700,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35}]}]}
