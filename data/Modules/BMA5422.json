{"moduleCode":"BMA5422","title":"How to Successfully Lead Your Groups and Teams","description":"This module objective is to focus on evidence-based\nmanagement to try and understand what drives the\nbehavior of groups and their members. Our job is to try\nand understand when, if, and how phenomena change as\nwe place people in situations where they need to rely on\nothers to get the job done. The module will loosely follow\nTuckman’s (1965) forming, storming, norming, and\nperforming model of group development. However, much\nof our attention will be focused on the forming stage, as\neverything that follows depends on successfully building\nthe team. In this module we will discuss the topics\nspecifically in the group and team context.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
