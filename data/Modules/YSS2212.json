{"moduleCode":"YSS2212","title":"Firms\u0027 Strategies and Market Competition","description":"In this course, we will study various strategies that firms deploy when facing market competition and the impact of such strategic behaviour on market outcomes like prices, efficiency, market structure, innovation etc. Examples of firms’ strategies include price discrimination, product differentiation, advertising, collusion, mergers and entry deterrence. We will analyse theoretical models of imperfectly competitive markets to gain insights into firms’ behaviour and functioning of real-world markets.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSS2203 Intermediate Microeconomics or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
