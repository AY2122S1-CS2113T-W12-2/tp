{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course introduces the topic of gender by using basic concepts like biological sex, nature, nurture, roles, norms and culture. The meaning of gender categories is examined in relation to difference, exchange, reproduction, knowledge and social change. Although the main perspective is ethnographic, this course is intended to be an exercise in interdisciplinary thinking. Understanding gender provides a foundation to analyze social structures (power and inequality), social institutions (family, kinship, education, economy, the state, health) and cultural issues (science, food, emotions, popular culture).","title":"Gender Studies","department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"SC2220","attributes":{"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS7-0119","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS3-0309","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT12","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS5-0205","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS1-0208","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"AS1-0205","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-04-25T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
