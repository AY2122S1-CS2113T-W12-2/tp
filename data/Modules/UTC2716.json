{"moduleCode":"UTC2716","title":"Networks: Complexity and Order","description":"A complex system entails a network of interconnections among its constituents. Take the network of friendships in a society. \"Six degrees of separation\" posits that any two persons in the world are connected through five or fewer other persons in this network. This amazing \"small world\" notion prompted scientists to study the organisational structure of networks. Indeed, many networks - however massive and complex - follow an order based on simple principles. In a minimally technical manner, this module follows this exciting development, which impacts our understanding of a plethora of phenomena from the spread of diseases to the propagation of opinions.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","preclusion":"UTC27%","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
