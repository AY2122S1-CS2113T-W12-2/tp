{"moduleCode":"YSC3242","title":"Agent-Based Modelling","description":"Agent-based modelling (ABM) simulates the behaviour of interacting individuals. At Oxford, the lecturer has taught it to students in biology, business, archaeology, economics, anthropology, etc. He has used ABM to collaborate with research projects that range from modelling religions, cancer cells, the Spanish Flu, the French Burka ban, fishing, farming, immigration, and medieval populations. The goal of this module is to introduce the students to ABM and to lead them into a term project that applies ABM to a concrete domain.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
