{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"YSS4221","description":"This module will introduce students to the study of the origins, development and cognitive processing of morality. The module will cover the beginnings of moral psychology, the early theories of moral development, the contemporary developmental research on infantsâ€™ and childrenâ€™s moral decisionâ€?making, and the influence of society (e.g., media, law, parenting) on childrenâ€™s moral development. Through lectures, discussions, course readings, and essay writing we will analyse and debate whether morality is innate, adaptive, and unique from other aspects of cognitive development.","title":"Moral Development","department":"Psychology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"PL1101E, PL2131 and PL2132.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PL3260","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"E6","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"E5","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-11-25T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"and":["PL1101E","PL2131","PL2132"]}}
