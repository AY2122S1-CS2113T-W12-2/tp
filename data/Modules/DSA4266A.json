{"moduleCode":"DSA4266A","title":"Sense-making Case Analysis: Science","description":"The practice of data science involves sense-making, the ability to formulate problems or hypotheses in real-world situations. Only when algorithms and technology are applied to meaningful problems or hypotheses can useful information be extracted from data for making decisions. This module is conducted as a series of hackathons: data scientists from partnering organisations in the science sector provide the real-world situations and data which will enable students to gain practical experience in (i) formulating problems, (ii) solving them by applying, or developing and implementing, appropriate data-analytic tools and techniques, and (iii) communicating findings and insights gained clearly.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CS3244 Machine Learning and DSA3101 Data Science in Practice, or by permission","preclusion":"DSA4266 Sense-making Case Analysis: Science and Technology","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
