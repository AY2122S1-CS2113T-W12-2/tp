Southeast Asia has evolved many distinctive local art forms in such media as textiles, metal, and stone sculpture. For over 2,000 years Southeast Asian artists have explored numerous sources of inspiration: their local environments, their national culture and political situation, changes instigated by politics, technology and the economy, link to other parts of Asia, and the global art community. This module will explore both the unique features of the individual works of art and the influences of various external forces which the artists experience and express.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
