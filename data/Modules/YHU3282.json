{"moduleCode":"YHU3282","title":"Equiano\u0027s Slave Narrative: Texts \u0026 Contexts","description":"This course uses The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, first published in 1789, to investigate both the invention of a new genre—the Atlantic slave narrative—and the historical context that shaped Equiano’s life. Written by a former slave and key antislavery activist, this multi-layered text personalizes major historical events, including the slave trade in West Africa, the transportation of 12 million Africans to America, and the anti-slavery movement. Combining aspects of the captivity narrative, travel writing, and spiritual autobiography, The Interesting Narrative will be treated as both a historical source and a literary work.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
