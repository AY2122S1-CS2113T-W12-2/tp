{"moduleCode":"EU4220","title":"Topics in European Literature","description":"This module, whose specific content may change from time to time within the following guidelines, presents an interdisciplinary approach, but one grounded in the literary, to a topic in European literature, especially but not exclusively from the Romantic, Modernist or Contemporary periods. Always comparative (across two nations at least), it considers aspects of a period, a movement, a thematic issue or a combination of all these. Texts are chosen not only for their intrinsic merits but for their complementarity to the English Literature curriculum in general, and, as a module crosslisted with European Studies, to that programme also.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80MCs, including 28 MCs in EU/ LA [French/German/Spanish]/recognised modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","preclusion":"EN4263","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
