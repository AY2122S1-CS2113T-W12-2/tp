{"moduleCode":"UTC1118","title":"Junior Seminar: The Social Lives of Drugs","description":"This junior seminar explores the relationship between drugs and culture. Drugs are powerful because of their material and symbolic value, their power to alter bodies and minds, and their ability to both harm and heal. By examining the social lives of drugs, from production to consumption, students will build the skills to critically ask how drugs affect lives across different societies. Besides the question how a plant, food, or substance becomes constituted as a drug in the first place, topics to be explored include the use of human subjects in clinical drug trials, the ‘pharmaceuticalization’ of health, and licit/illicit drugs.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"(For Tembusu students only)","preclusion":"GEM1902% or GEM1912% or UTC11%","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
