{"moduleCode":"UTS2410","title":"Stakeholders: Community Engagement as a Sum of Diverse Parts","description":"We often discuss the ‘What’ and ‘Why’ of Community Engagement. However, we seldom explore the ‘Who’ of Community Engagement: the stakeholders. This module explores the dynamic relationship between Community Engagement and its stakeholders. We will look at definitions of stakeholders and how they impact the efficacy, direction, processes, and perceptions of Community Engagement in Singapore. We will focus on the government, social service agencies, donors, businesses, volunteers, community members and university students such as yourself, and adopt an interdisciplinary approach to analyse how they interact with one another. Finally, we will explore technology\u0027s rapidly changing role in Community Engagement.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"UTC11%, UTC14%, UTC17% (UTCP Junior Seminar)","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"CAPT-SR1-2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":7},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"CAPT-SR1-2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":7},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"CAPT-SR1-2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":7},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"CAPT-SR1-2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":7}]}]}
