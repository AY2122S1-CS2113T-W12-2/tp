{"moduleCode":"CM5235","title":"Applied Computational Chemistry","description":"The application of computational chemistry to molecular structure (equilibrium and transition-states), spectroscopy (IR, Raman, NMR, UV-Vis), chemical kinetics (statistical and dynamic) and reaction mechanisms will be examined. Models of chemistry in the gas, liquid and solid phases (via molecular dynamics and Monte-Carlo simulations) as well as interfaces will be considered. Visualization of proteins and other large systems will be addressed. Enough fundamental theory in quantum, molecular and statistical mechanics will be given to understand and correctly interpret and appreciate the limits of the models and results of calculations. Hands-on calculations using state-of-the-art modelling software and visualisation tools will be utilized.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM3231 Quantum Chemistry and Molecular Thermodynamics","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120}]}]}
