{"moduleCode":"PC5204","title":"Magnetism and Spintronics","description":"Spintronics is the study of the intrinsic spin of the electron and its application in spin-logic and devices, spin-polarized injection devices, and storage media.  This is important for a variety of current and emerging applications in magnetic memories.  This course equips students with essential knowledge of magnetism, and exchange interactions in solids; half metals, and dilute magnetic semiconductors; spin injection, transport and detection; and magnetic nanostructures, and their applications in: GMR read-write heads, MRAM, spinFET, spin-torque oscillators.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC3235, PC4240, and PC4241 or equivalent modules approved by the lecturer or Department Approval","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Hybrid_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":48},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Hybrid_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":48}]}]}
