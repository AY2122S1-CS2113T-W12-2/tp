{"moduleCode":"EN4245","title":"Narrative, Narration, Auteur","description":"This module examines the process of narrative construction and narration in relation to an \u0027auteur\u0027 approach that considers film authorship in terms of a director\u0027s \u0027signature style\u0027.\n\nThrough close analysis of the work of three different directors, we will:\n\n1) explore the relationship between form, ideology and narrative, and the influence of the socio-cultural context on storytelling and meaning making;\n\n2) pursue and evaluate the auteur theory - Who is an author, specifically in film, where teamwork is everything? What makes a director an auteur?  What cultural and/or ideological implications reside in the development, alteration or evolution of an auteur\u0027s style?","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN, or 28 MCs in TS, and EN2203, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
