{"moduleCode":"PP5227","title":"Principles and Policies in Sustainability and the Environment","description":"This course is designed to improve the understanding and applications of the principles and policies of sustainability and the environment. It examines the policy challenges of achieving global sustainability where strides have been made in some respects, notably poverty alleviation, while others, strikingly climate change and mass species extinction, have accelerated at alarming rates. The course will shift attention from “implementing” what are often self-standing and competing sustainability goals, to focusing on developing “fit for purpose” policy designs for effectively and urgently prioritizing make or break sustainability conundrums.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","preclusion":"MP5227A, MP5227B","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"LKY_SR2-1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90}]}]}
