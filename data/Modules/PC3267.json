{"moduleCode":"PC3267","title":"Biophysics II","description":"This module aims to introduce the principles and approaches of physics in the area of molecular biophysics. It includes molecular complexes of biomolecules; physical and symmetrical relationships between biomolecules; physical and structural characteristics of proteins and amino acids; symmetric and statistical descriptions of nucleic acids; first law and second law of thermodynamics in biological systems; bonding and non-bonding potentials, and stabilizing interactions in biomacromolecules, and the correlation to macromolecular structures; molecular mechanics in biological systems; bio soft condensed materials, bio-membrane and biomembrane structure, principles of molecular self assembly of biomolecules. There is a lab component included in this module.  This module is targeted at both physics and non-physics students who already have basic knowledge in physics and life sciences.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC2131 or PC2267 or EE2011 or Departmental Approval","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 23, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":42},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":42}]}]}
