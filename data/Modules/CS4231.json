{"moduleCode":"CS4231","title":"Parallel and Distributed Algorithms","description":"This course will examine some fundamental issues in parallel programming and distributed computing, and the relationships between the two.  Parallel programming: mutual exclusion, semaphores, consistency, wait-free synchronization.  Distributed computing: time, global state, snapshots, message ordering.  Relationships: consensus, fault-tolerance, transactions, self-stabilization.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms or CS3210 Parallel Computing","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 27, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2030,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100}]}]}
