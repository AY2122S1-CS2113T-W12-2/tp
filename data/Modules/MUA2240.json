{"moduleCode":"MUA2240","title":"Collaborative Piano - Piano Ensemble","description":"As a logical progression from modules MUA1111 and MUA1112, students will continue to study and perform works for piano ensemble - either piano duos or duets. Coaching sessions provide in-depth insight into the specific piece(s) chosen for study; whilst active participation is expected in the studio class, which provides an overview of the most significant works relevant to the genre. Students must participate in a public, assessed performance as the final examination of the prepared work(s); and to reflect upon their learning process in the context of this module by updating their e-portfolios.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"MUA1112","preclusion":"MUA2155","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
