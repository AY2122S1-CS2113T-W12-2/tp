{"moduleCode":"PP5705","title":"Comparative Public Policy and Management: Singapore and Asia","description":"This module provides a coherent analysis of Singapore’s development experiences focusing on the economic outcomes, political leadership, policy design and implementation, institutions and the interaction between these components. The objective is to provide students with greater insights into the policies that have shaped Singapore’s economic development, sharpen their understanding of policy making and implementation in Singapore and encourage them to reflect on its relevance to their own country and organisations. The module will draw upon the expertise of senior government policy- and decision-makers as well as those who have been involved or researched in policy-making. It will involve visits to relevant institutions in Singapore and a short attachment to a government agency in Singapore.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LKY_SR3-3","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}]}]}
