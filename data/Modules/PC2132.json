{"moduleCode":"PC2132","title":"Classical Mechanics","description":"This module aims to consider the principles of mechanics in a rigorous mathematical framework, and to establish a bridge to the principles of modern physics. The topics to be covered include: kinematics; damped and driven oscillators; energy and angular momentum, conservative forces; twobody\nand many-body problems, centre-of-mass; central-force motion, inverse square law, orbits, scattering; action principle; Lagrangian mechanics; Hamiltonian mechanics; small-amplitude oscillations, normal modes; rotating rigid bodies; rotating reference frames, centrifugal and Coriolis forces, Foucault\u0027s pendulum. A good command of calculus and some basic knowledge of linear algebra are required.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students who have either passed (PC1141 or PC1431/ PC1431X or PC1433) and (MA1101R or MA1513 or MA1508E) and (MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1511 or MA1512) or equivalent.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1100,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":100}]}]}
