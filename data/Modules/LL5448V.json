{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"LL4448/LL5448/LL6448/LLJ5448 Legal History: Themes and Perspectives","description":"The common-law world only exists because of its shared history. History explains the common lawyerâ€™s profession. This module introduces the study of legal history with an eye to its contemporary relevance. It concentrates on the colonial roots of the laws and legal institutions of common-law countries such as Singapore. By examining colonial settings across three centuries, we shall see how English law dealt with cultural plurality and territorial expansion, and how imperial stakeholders debated and applied ideas from the rule of law to judicial independence. We explore why, how, and for whom law was made, and how these dynamics changed upon decolonisation.","title":"Legal History: Themes and Perspectives","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"LL5448V","aliases":["LL4448V","LL6448V"],"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Hybrid_D","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
