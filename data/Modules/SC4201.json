{"moduleCode":"SC4201","title":"Contemporary Social Theory","description":"This module maps out the main currents of contemporary social theories ranging from the legacy of the classical tradition, comparative-historical sociology, interpretative sociology, functionalism and neo-functionalism, rational choice, globalization theories and the macro-micro debates. In exploring the nature and status of social scientific theories we deal with the universalism/relativism debate and link it to the problems of globalized vs. indigenized social theories. This module is mounted for students with a keen interest in social theories.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC, or 28MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC, or 28MCs in PS or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non?language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":55}]}]}
