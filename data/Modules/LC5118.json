{"moduleCode":"LC5118","title":"Foreign Direct Investment Law in Asia","description":"In this course, students will  act as lawyers advising an international investor in a mock transaction in a developing Asian jurisdiction. They must identify the legal risks for the investor in this developing environment and advise ways to mitigate such risks. Students will study relevant local laws, draft contractual documents, analyse legal issues, give advice, negotiate with local partners and bring the deal to closure. Through this, students are expected to form an overview of the risks for an international investor in these developing Asian systems and ways to mitigate such risks through negotiation and documentation. Furthermore, students will also research  particular issues such as expropriation, change in law, currency conversion or performance by State owned companies for the purposes of the assignment. To do this, students will need to study the investment law, administrative law, conflict of laws, corporate law, contract law and arbitration law of some selected Asian jurisdictions.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
