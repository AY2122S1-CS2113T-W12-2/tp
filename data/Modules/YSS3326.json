{"moduleCode":"YSS3326","title":"Liberalism and Its Critics","description":"The course will build upon the knowledge of early modern liberalism that students learn in PPT 2.  We will begin with an examination of John Locke’s classic work of liberalism, The Second Treatise of Government. We will then examine Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s critique of liberal state of nature theories in his Discourse on the Origin of Inequality.  After that we turn to twentieth-century critiques of liberalism offered by Virginia Woolf, Malcolm X, and Michel Foucault. Here we will study how liberalism relies on masculine (Woolf), racist (Malcolm X) or disciplinary (Foucault) mechanisms and examine the political alternatives offered by these thinkers.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
