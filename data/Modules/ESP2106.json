{"moduleCode":"ESP2106","title":"Principles of Continua","description":"The primary objective of the module is to develop a fundamental understanding of how to formulate the governing equations of continua with the aid of basic conservation laws of physics that govern the behaviour of a continuum. An allied objective is to apply the governing equations to simplified as well as industrially-relevant problems in solid mechanics and fluid mechanics. Overall, this course provides a foundation for the role of continuum mechanics in engineering and science.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Engineering Science Programme","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
