{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The primary objective of the module is to develop a fundamental understanding of how to formulate the governing equations of continua with the aid of basic conservation laws of physics that govern the behaviour of a continuum. An allied objective is to apply the governing equations to simplified as well as industrially-relevant problems in solid mechanics and fluid mechanics. Overall, this course provides a foundation for the role of continuum mechanics in engineering and science.","title":"Principles of Continua","department":"Engineering Science Programme","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[3,1,0,3,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ESP2106","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
