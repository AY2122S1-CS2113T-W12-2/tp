{"moduleCode":"UTC2415","title":"The Effective Non-profit","description":"In this module, we will examine some organisational processes and behaviors in the context of non-profit organisations (NPOs). Through readings, case studies, guest speakers, and field trips, we will explore the interdisciplinary aspects of organisational behavior from the individual, team, organisational and societal levels of analysis. We will discuss topics such as— What motivates employees and volunteers? How can NPOs drive a positive organisational culture? What are some “success indicators” in a NPO? How can we create an inclusive community in the workplace for persons with disabilities? How do NPOs evolve to “keep up with the times”?","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"UTC11%, UTC14%, UTC17% (UTCP Junior Seminar)","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"CAPT-SR1-2","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"CAPT-SR1-2","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}]}]}
