{"moduleCode":"GEM1913","title":"Beasts, People and Wild Environments in South Asia","description":"How do ideas about big beasts and the wild inform our socio?cultural worldview? In other words, what is a “tiger” when it is not just a zoo animal but one that lives in a forest next to your home? In this introductory and interdisciplinary course to conservation and the environment, we will watch films and discuss novels and ethnographies focusing on human/animal relations in six different spheres: Mountains, Deserts, Rivers, Plains, Forests, and Sea. The course aims to be an informative, provocative and fun introduction to an exciting and relatively new field of scholarship.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GEH1010","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
