{"moduleCode":"YSC2222","title":"Organic Chemistry Laboratory","description":"The structure, properties, and reactivity of carbon-based molecules will be directly observed and inferred in this laboratory-based course, which supplements YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry. Students will put their newly acquired theoretical knowledge in practice and thus gain a much deeper understanding of the material. Topics include reaction set-up and purification, IR, NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS analysis, as well as an advanced synthesis project.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry or with the permission of the instructor.","corequisite":"YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1430,"endTime":1730,"venue":"Y-ChemLab","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
