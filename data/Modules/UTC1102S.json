{"moduleCode":"UTC1102S","title":"Living and Dying in the Internet Age","description":"Now, more than ever, we live, die and live on through Internet technologies such as Web sites, social networking platforms and gaming environments. But how does this ‘living, dying and living on’ through the Internet relate to our ‘bodily living, dying and living on’? Using different disciplinary perspectives, this module will dwell on two questions: (1) How do we make sense of life, death and after-death in the Internet era? (2) How can we respond, through new ways of thinking, practices, policy or design, to the new challenges and questions associated with life, death and after-death today?","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","preclusion":"GEM1902% or GEM1912% or UTC11%","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
