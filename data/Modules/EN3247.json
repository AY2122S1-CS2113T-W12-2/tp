{"moduleCode":"EN3247","title":"Introduction to Critical Theory","description":"This module considers the theoretical postulates underwriting such different \"movements\" as modernism, structuralism, post-structuralism, reader-response criticism, feminism, psychoanalytic criticism, Marxism, and new historicism. Focusing on position papers representing some of the defining features of these various critical currents, discussion centers on three primary items: author, text, and reader. Key topics: How are texts read? What is the nature of authorial authority? How are meanings constructed and created?  What is the role of the reader in the reading process? Students will read elusive but influential literary and social theorists such as Derrida, Lacan, Foucault, and others. Target students: English Literature majors.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"(i) EN1101E AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","corequisite":"So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
