{"moduleCode":"CS5239","title":"Computer System Performance Analysis","description":"The objective of this module is to provide students a working knowledge of computer performance evaluation and capacity planning. They will be able to identify performance bottlenecks, to predict when performance limits of a system will be exceeded, and to characterise present and future workload to perform capacity planning activities. Topics include: performance analysis overview; measurement techniques and  tools including workload characterisation, instrumentation, benchmarking, analytical modelling techniques including operational analysis, stochastic queuing network analysis; performance of client-server architectures; capacity planning; case studies.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"((CS1020 or its equivalent) or CS2020 or (CS2030 or its equivalent) or CS2113/T) and (EE2012/A or ST2132 or ST2334 or ((MA2216 or ST2131) and (ST1131/A or ST1232 or DSC2008)))","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2030,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":110},{"classNo":"1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":110}]}]}
