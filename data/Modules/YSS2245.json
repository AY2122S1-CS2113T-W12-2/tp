{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module introduces the anthropology of marriage and kinship, asking questions like: How does the creation of kin through marriage vary cross-culturally? How and why do states exercise control over marriage? Why are people marrying later and having fewer babies, and how will this development shape societies in the twenty-first century? Who has access to marriage, who does not, and why? Is marriage a tool of patriarchal domination? Or can it become a site for culturally and historically specific forms of agency? Students will conduct original research and read ethnographies of places around the world with a focus on Asia.","title":"Marriage and Kinship","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,2.5,7],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS2245","semesterData":[]}
