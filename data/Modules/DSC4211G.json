{"moduleCode":"DSC4211G","title":"SIOSCM: Service Design","description":"Service design is a process that seeks to understand ways to develop the environments and programs that lead to a high level of service quality. Often times, the success of a business is dependent on the quality of service that is\nprovided to its customers.
