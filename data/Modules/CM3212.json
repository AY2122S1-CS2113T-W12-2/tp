{"moduleCode":"CM3212","title":"Transition Metal Chemistry","description":"This module covers the chemistry of d-block and f-block metals. An introduction to observed trend in physical and chemical properties of d-block transition metal complexes will be given. A comprehensive discussion on their electronic structures and spectra follows. Magnetic property, ligand substitution and redox reaction of these metal complexes will be illustrated. The f-block metals will be introduced leading to a discussion of the optical spectra of their complexes. Introduction to inorganic supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering and solid state chemistry will be covered.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM2111","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1100,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":38},{"classNo":"2","startTime":900,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":37},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1100,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":37}]}]}
