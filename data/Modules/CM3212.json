{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module covers the chemistry of d-block and f-block metals. An introduction to observed trend in physical and chemical properties of d-block transition metal complexes will be given. A comprehensive discussion on their electronic structures and spectra follows. Magnetic property, ligand substitution and redox reaction of these metal complexes will be illustrated. The f-block metals will be introduced leading to a discussion of the optical spectra of their complexes. Introduction to inorganic supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering and solid state chemistry will be covered.","title":"Transition Metal Chemistry","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,3,3],"prerequisite":"CM2111","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM3212","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":38,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":37,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":37,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}],"prereqTree":"CM2111","fulfillRequirements":["CM4211","CM4212","CM4214","CM4215"]}
