{"moduleCode":"PP5528","title":"Designing Markets and Marketplaces","description":"This course aims to broaden one\u0027s perspective on markets and marketplaces. We learn how to design markets, institutions, and organizations in practice, and analyze their allocative properties, induced incentives, and limitations, to help formulate regulatory policy. The course underscores practical takeaways in designing a wide range of markets, e.g., auctions for procurement and spectrum allocation, matching markets to assign students to schools, doctors to hospitals, and resettle refugees, centralized versus decentralized labor markets for civil servants, online market platforms, natural monopolies for electricity, and incentive schemes promoting pharmaceutical R\u0026D. We cover issues like fairness, efficiency, simplicity, transparency, externalities, and collusion.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","prerequisite":"No pre-requisites\n(Core Microeconomics recommended)","corequisite":"No co-requisites (Core Microeconomics recommended)","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
