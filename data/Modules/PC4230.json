{"moduleCode":"PC4230","title":"Quantum Mechanics III","description":"This third undergraduate module in quantum mechanics starts with a recap of the main contents covered by lower-level quantum mechanics courses, in particular time-independent and time-dependent perturbation theory, with more depth. Matlab is introduced to implement the discrete variable representation to solve time-independent Schrodinger equations, and the Split-Operator technique to solve time-dependent Schrodinger equations, with necessary coding from the stratch. This module also covers a number of frontiers topics, including adiabatic theorem, adiabatic control, shortcuts to adiabaticity, geometric phases, density matrix, reduced density matrix, quantum measurement models, quantum master equations, spin-boson model, decoherence, and dynamical decoupling.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC3130","preclusion":"PC4130","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Dec 2, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
