{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"PC4130","description":"This third undergraduate module in quantum mechanics starts with a recap of the main contents covered by lower-level quantum mechanics courses, in particular time-independent and time-dependent perturbation theory, with more depth. Matlab is introduced to implement the discrete variable representation to solve time-independent Schrodinger equations, and the Split-Operator technique to solve time-dependent Schrodinger equations, with necessary coding from the stratch. This module also covers a number of frontiers topics, including adiabatic theorem, adiabatic control, shortcuts to adiabaticity, geometric phases, density matrix, reduced density matrix, quantum measurement models, quantum master equations, spin-boson model, decoherence, and dynamical decoupling.","title":"Quantum Mechanics III","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,2,0,0,5],"prerequisite":"PC3130","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC4230","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-12-02T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"PC3130","fulfillRequirements":["PC5206"]}
