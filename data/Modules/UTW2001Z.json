{"moduleCode":"UTW2001Z","title":"The Semiotics of Colour","description":"Colour is key in visual communication. In this module, students will engage with the topic from a social semiotics and multimodal perspective to explore how colour meanings, for example ideational, interpersonal and textual, are created and interpreted. Students will develop a research paper around an artefact of their choice from fields such as marketing, design, visual and performing arts or their discipline, to examine how colour conveys meanings and/or how these colour meanings are perceived in the community. Through their project, students may explore a range of social issues related to, for example, gender and race.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"UTW1001%","preclusion":"Students who have already read an UTW2001% module.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"3","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"3","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16}]}]}
