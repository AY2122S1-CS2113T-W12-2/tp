{"moduleCode":"EE4101E","title":"Radio-Frequency (RF) Communications","description":"Radio and microwave systems are used for information transmission.  This module therefore introduces the student to a broad range of enabling knowledge and skills commonly employed by RF and microwave engineers to specify, analyse and design radio and microwave transmission systems.  Topics covered:  Time-varying EM fields: guided waves, evanescent modes and plane-wave propagation. Radiation: radiation mechanism, magnetic vector potential, current distribution on a thin wire, Hertzian dipole, Half-wave dipole \u0026 monopole. RF Antennas: parameters, aperture antennas and arrays.  RF Amplification: stability, gain and small-signal narrowband design.  RF Generation:  conditions for oscillation, oscillator design and dielectric resonators.   RF Receivers:  receiver and mixer parameters.  RF Systems: system gain and noise figure, satellite and terrestrial systems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SCALE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"EE2011E","preclusion":"TEE4101","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
