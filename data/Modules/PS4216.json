{"moduleCode":"PS4216","title":"The Study of War","description":"Traditionally, as a discipline, International Relations has treated war as the use of the military instrument by states. This module aims to introduce students to an elementary comprehension of war as a form of politics. A philosophical approach will be taken towards an exposition of general theories of war, as well as land, air, sea, guerrilla and nuclear warfare. It will round off by inquiring whether war studies should necessarily encompass human security today. In this way, the field becomes open to Critical Theory and Postmodern perspectives as well. Students are strongly encouraged to read PS2237 Introduction to International Relations before signing up.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
