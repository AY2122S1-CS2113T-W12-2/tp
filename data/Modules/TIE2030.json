{"moduleCode":"TIE2030","title":"Programming Methodology with Python","description":"This modules introduces fundamental programming methodologies for solving real-life complex problem using Python with emphasis in industrial operations and supply chains management oriented applications. Topics include problem solving by computing, writing pseudo-codes, problem formulation and problem solving, program development, coding, testing and debugging, fundamental programming constructs (variables, types, expressions, assignments, functions, control structures, etc.), fundamental data structures: arrays, strings and structures, data processing using large scale data sets from files, visualization, facilitating a design towards solving complex problems. Module will expose both Python and one or more of its variants used for scientific computations such as SciPy and NumPy.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SCALE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","preclusion":"TE2101/TEE2101 Programming Methodology TIC1001 Introduction to Computing and Programming I","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":80},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2030,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80}]}]}
