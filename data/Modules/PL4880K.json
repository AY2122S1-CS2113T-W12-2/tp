{"moduleCode":"PL4880K","title":"Parenting and Child Development","description":"This course examines the various aspects of parental influence on children’s development, with a focus on cultural differences in parenting practices. Topics to be covered include a critical evaluation of the crosscultural relevance of parenting styles and the concept of emotional availability in accounting for differences in children’s developmental outcomes. The notion of “good enough parenting” and parenting as a bidirectional process will be analysed.
