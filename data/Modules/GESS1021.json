{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"SSA2218, TS2238, GES1029","description":"This module explores the ways in which Singapore films constitute a national cinema by considering the history and development of local film production as well as closely examining how individual films perform and engage the notion of a Singapore identity. Through a group creative project, students are challenged to make their own Singapore film that involves the practical application of critical ideas and enables students to participate in the ways that a national cinema performs and functions. The films studied may involve mature content and have varied film ratings.","title":"Singapore Film: Performance of Identity","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GESS1021","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"su":true},"aliases":["GES1029"],"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E4","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":4,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":4,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":4,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":4,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
