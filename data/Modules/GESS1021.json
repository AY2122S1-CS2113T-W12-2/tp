{"moduleCode":"GESS1021","title":"Singapore Film: Performance of Identity","description":"This module explores the ways in which Singapore films constitute a national cinema by considering the history and development of local film production as well as closely examining how individual films perform and engage the notion of a Singapore identity. Through a group creative project, students are challenged to make their own Singapore film that involves the practical application of critical ideas and enables students to participate in the ways that a national cinema performs and functions. The films studied may involve mature content and have varied film ratings.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"SSA2218, TS2238, GES1029","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E4","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":4},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":4},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":4},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":4}]}]}
