{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"GEK1022, GEH1022","description":"GE 1022 K (GEOPOLITICS) is an exciting introduction to the world of practical, formal and popular geopolitics via numerous case studies and multi-media presentations. The basic aim is that each of you will become familiar with the world political map and the relevance of geopolitics as ways of understanding and seeing our world. The Geopolitics module provides an engaging way to integrate aspects of modern history with political geography, for instance through the analysis of nationalisms and territorial disputes (in different parts of the world); through the study of the Cold War in relation to changing political landscapes in Southeast Asia; and through more contemporary understandings of the global geopolitics associated with the so-called War on Terror; and global issues of ecological security and environmental geopolitics.","title":"Geopolitics: Geographies of War & Peace","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEC1007","attributes":{"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":2,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":2,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":2,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E6","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":2,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"UTSRC-LT52","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":10,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"AS2-0203","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":2,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-05T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
