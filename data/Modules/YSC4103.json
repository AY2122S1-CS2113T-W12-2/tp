It allows students the opportunity to pursue, in depth, an advanced project of their own choosing, under the guidance of a faculty supervisor. The Capstone is intended to: \n• give students the opportunity to work independently;\n• encourage students to develop and exhibit aspects of their ability that may not be revealed by course work or a written examination;\n• foster skills and attributes that will be of continuing usefulness in their later career.","moduleCredit":10.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"All Year 1 and 2 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1430,"endTime":1530,"venue":"Y-BlackBox","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
