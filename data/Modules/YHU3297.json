{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"What does good reasoning look like? What does it aim for? How should\nwe argue with our opponents? NyÄ?ya, a tradition within Brahminical\nIndian philosophy presented and defended sophisticated methods of\nreasoning and norms for debate that are still being studied today. In this\ncourse, we focus on sections of the NyÄ?ya-sÅ«tra in translation and its\nearly commentaries, along with some Buddhist and MÄ«mÄ?á¹ƒsÄ? texts. Not\nonly will we consider methods and norms, but we will look at how\nIndian thinkers put them into practice in arguments on topics such as\nthe existence of God.","title":"Debate and Reasoning in Indian Philosophy","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 and one Philosophy module or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU3297","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["YCC1113","YCC1114"]}}
