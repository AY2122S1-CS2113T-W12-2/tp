{"moduleCode":"YHU3297","title":"Debate and Reasoning in Indian Philosophy","description":"What does good reasoning look like? What does it aim for? How should\nwe argue with our opponents? Ny?ya, a tradition within Brahminical\nIndian philosophy presented and defended sophisticated methods of\nreasoning and norms for debate that are still being studied today. In this\ncourse, we focus on sections of the Ny?ya-s?tra in translation and its\nearly commentaries, along with some Buddhist and M?m??s? texts. Not\nonly will we consider methods and norms, but we will look at how\nIndian thinkers put them into practice in arguments on topics such as\nthe existence of God.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 and one Philosophy module or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
