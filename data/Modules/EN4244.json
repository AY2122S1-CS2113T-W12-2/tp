{"moduleCode":"EN4244","title":"Topics in Cultural Studies","description":"Cultural Studies seeks out provocative juxtapositions and surprising connections between apparently disparate phenomena, such as entertainment and global economics, personal and private domains, identity formation and desire, military strategy/technology and aesthetics. It conducts a critical inquiry into the formation of daily existence through the examination of discursive practices, ideologies, technology and/or mass media. The module provides a means for exploring in depth the work of one or more Cultural Studies theorists while contextualizing these inquiries in more specific intellectual domains and exploring, critically, the possibilities provided by these critical interventions.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 29, 2022, 2:30:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"AS1-0303","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
