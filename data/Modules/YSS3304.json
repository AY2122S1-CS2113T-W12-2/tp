{"moduleCode":"YSS3304","title":"Port Cities: Logistics, Transnationality, Urbanization","description":"Port cities across the world have long played a crucial role as nodes of exchange and interaction in ever more extensive networks of production, culture, and power. Conversely, global flows of capital, people, and knowledge have been increasingly preponderant in shaping processes of urbanization since the dawn of maritime trade. Based on a program of field visits to relevant sites across the city, this module takes Singapore as an example to consider patterns, functions, and images of port cities as well as the transnational currents that have given shape to urbanism past and present.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
