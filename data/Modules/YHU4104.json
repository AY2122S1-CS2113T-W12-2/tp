This module supports the implementation of the capstone project through the development of self-regulated research excellence. Arts and Humanities students will pursue their research, construct creative works, and consider methodological issues together to critique and improve each other's written work in a seminar setting. Over the 13 weeks, students will fine-tune research skills as well as oral and written communication skills collaboratively. Experts from The Writers’ Centre, the Library, Arts Spaces and CIPE will also enhance the module.","title":"Arts and Humanities Capstone Project","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,2,0,5,5.5],"prerequisite":"All Year 1 and 2 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"10","moduleCode":"YHU4104","attributes":{"fyp":true,"year":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-GLRm2","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR3","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
