{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This is an advanced laboratory module for students to carry out analytical and physical chemistry experiments. Further skills in the preparation and  characterization of complex samples and knowledge of the operations of more specialised instruments will be imparted to the students. The knowledge and skills learned in this module will also serve as a link to the current practices in the\nchemical industry.","title":"Advanced Experiments In Analytical & Physical Chemistry","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[0,0,6,2,2],"prerequisite":"CM2101 and CM2192","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM3292","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0402","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0402","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S7-0401","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S7-0401","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S7-0401","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0402","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S7-0401","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0402","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT21","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["Unknown","B"]},{"semester":4,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":{"start":"2022-06-20","end":"2022-07-25"},"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1600","weeks":{"start":"2022-06-23","end":"2022-07-28"},"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":{"start":"2022-06-21","end":"2022-07-26"},"venue":"LT20","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["Unknown","B"]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["CM2101","CM2192"]}}
