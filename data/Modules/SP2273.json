{"moduleCode":"SP2273","title":"Working on Interdisciplinary Science, Pythonically","description":"Computing plays a crucial role in how science understands our world. It is often considered the \u0027third pillar\u0027 of science, alongside theory and experiments. This course will allow you to experience how computers can be used to solve fun and interesting problems (e.g. climate models, real-time measurements), in interdisciplinary science. You will also learn how to approach tackling complex problems by breaking them into smaller ones, noting similarities, identifying what data is essential and devising steps that will lead to a solution. We will then learn to use the Python programming language to implement some of these solutions.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoS Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Pass in any two of the following GCE ‘A’-level /H2 subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, either Mathematics or Further Mathematics; or equivalent.","preclusion":"SP2171, SP2173 and SP2174","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"5","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"S16-0430","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT29","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":200},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT28","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":200},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"4","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40}]}]}
