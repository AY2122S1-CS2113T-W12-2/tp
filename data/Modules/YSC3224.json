{"moduleCode":"YSC3224","title":"Statistical Thermodynamics","description":"This is a first course in equilibrium statistical thermodynamics. It begins with examining the concepts of probability, microstates and macrostates in understanding thermal phenomena, linking these to entropy, the Boltzmann factor, ensembles, and the partition function.  We apply these concepts to elementary physical and chemical models such as classical and quantum gases, solids, phase transitions, chemical reactions, solute?solvent interactions, polymer structure. Within the Physical Sciences major, it will count toward pathways in biophysics, chemistry, chemical physics, materials science, nanoscience, physics, or related fields.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC1207 General Chemistry and  YSC1213 General Physics or with the permission of the instructor.","preclusion":"YSC2228 Statistical Thermodynamics","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
