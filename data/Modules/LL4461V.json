{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"LL4461 / LL5461 / LL6461 / LLJ5461 Compliance and Risk\nManagement","description":"This course examines the rules and standards that govern the subject of compliance and risk management. It starts by examining questions of governance: boards of directors, and executives. We then examine the compliance function\nthrough the lens of managers, regulators, prosecutors, whistle blowers, and gatekeepers. Next, we consider particular areas of the law: corruption, anti-money\nlaundering, and export controls. We examine case studies where compliance fails and initiatives that go beyond compliance. Finally, we consider risk management as it pertains to lawyers; topics here include the governance of risk; approaches to risk management; reputational, operational, and enterprise risk.","title":"Compliance and Risk Management","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.\nCriminal Law","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"LL4461V","aliases":["LL5461V","LL6461V"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Hybrid_D","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":38,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
