{"moduleCode":"PS3225","title":"Political Islam","description":"This module explores the rise, transformation, and sources of appeal of Islamist movements and organizations around the world. It is divided in two parts: the first part reviews the development of Islamic political thought from late nineteenth century to the present, covering the work of modernist, neo-revivalist and liberal Islamic thinkers. The second part examines Islamist ideas in practice in order to flesh out the ways in which Muslim ideologues have inspired forms of political mobilization and contestation. Primarily focusing on the Middle East, the second part investigates specific Islamist movements in historical and comparative perspective.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS7-0119","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS1-0201","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS1-0201","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
