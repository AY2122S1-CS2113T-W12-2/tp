{"moduleCode":"UTC1702D","title":"Thinking in Systems: Population Dynamics","description":"Many of the world’s problems are linked to population changes: rapidly aging population, immigration woes, and the threat of environmental degradation to human existence.\n\nIn this module, students will be introduced to population trends and be equipped to better understand fertility, mortality and migration and how they cause changes in population size, composition and distribution. It  incorporates basic concepts, data sources and tools used in demography into a systems approach to modelling population dynamics.\n\nStudents will build models of increasing complexity, covering a variety of generic structures and classic system dynamics modelling scenarios.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","preclusion":"GEM1914 or GEM1915% or GEM1918 or GEM1919 or GET1011 or UTC1411 or UTC1702% or UTC1701 or UTC1700","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"RC4-SR4","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1300,"endTime":1500,"venue":"RC4-SR4","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":9},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1700,"venue":"RC4-SR4","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"RC4-SR4","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"RC4-SR3","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16}]}]}
