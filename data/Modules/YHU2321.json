{"moduleCode":"YHU2321","title":"Virtue, Reason and Nature","description":"In the wake of the second World War, Oxford philosophers Iris Murdoch, Elizabeth Anscombe and Philippa Foot recognized the imperative for a new mode of moral philosophy, at once ambitious and fully natural. They initiated what became the reclamation of the resources of the Greek tradition, primarily Aristotle, in Anglophone moral thought.\nThis course explores the naturalised rationalism and moral psychology of neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics: What is a virtue? What are the virtues, and why? How can moral thought respect both our rationality and our animality, both our common humanity and our diversity? And might there be something still better then virtue?","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 or with the permission of the instructor.","corequisite":"YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
