{"moduleCode":"ME3261E","title":"Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing","description":"This course covers the principles of computer-aided tools: CAD and CAM, which are widely used in modern design and manufacturing industry. By introducing the mathematical background and fundamental part programming of CAD/CAM, this course provides the basics for students to understand the techniques and their industrial applications. The topics are: CAD: geometric modelling methods for curves, surfaces, and solids; CAM: part fabrication by CNC machining based on given geometric model; Basics of CNC machining; Tool path generation in CAD/CAM (Option to introduce a CAM software to generate a CNC program for the machining of a part); Verification of fabricated part by CNC measurement based on given geometric model. The module is targeted at students specializing in manufacturing engineering.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SCALE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","preclusion":"TM3261, TME3261","corequisite":"ME3162E, TM2162, ME2162E and TME2162","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2030,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":5},{"classNo":"1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":5}]}]}
