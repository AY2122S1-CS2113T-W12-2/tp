It focuses on the rebuilding of trust and cooperation between Serbs, Croats and Bosnias/Muslims in several new nation-states after the wars and genocides of the 1990s.  It offers students an interactive learning opportunity that combines development and conflict/peace theories, classroom discussions in Singapore, and a study trip.
