{"moduleCode":"MLE2103A","title":"Materials Kinetics \u0026 Processing","description":"Thermodynamics controls what can happen, but kinetics determines how fast it occurs. The rate at which a material is grown massively affects its properties; nickel alloys, for example, can be grown slowly to form single-crystal jet engine turbine blades or rapidly to make the nanowires used in optoelectronic devices and biomedical sensors. Controlled drug delivery can be achieved by designing polymeric materials that react inside the patient to release their payload at a pre-specified rate. Students reading this module will examine the mechanisms that underlie meta-stable materials, precipitation, grain growth, devitrification, the development of microstructures and nanostructures, and more.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"MLE2103","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
