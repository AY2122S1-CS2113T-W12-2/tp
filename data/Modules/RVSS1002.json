{"moduleCode":"RVSS1002","title":"Feeding the belly of a nation","description":"Singapore’s present unique combination of cultures is a rich and diverse foodscape steeped in history. Our hawker culture listing to the Unesco List of Intangible Cultural Heritage highlights the importance and value we place in our food heritage. Singaporeans pride themselves on ‘hunting down’ cheap and good food but feeding such a diverse population is a complex endeavour. The module takes students on a journey from farm to table, uncovering how food is produced and consumed in Singapore. Students learn though seminar discussions, field trips to farms and group explorations to hawker centres.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Ridge View Residential College","faculty":"Residential College","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"G1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1700,"venue":"RVR-SRM03","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18},{"classNo":"G2","startTime":1500,"endTime":1700,"venue":"RVR-SRM03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":18}]}]}
