{"moduleCode":"PH3203","title":"Moral Philosophy","description":"This module is concerned with an area in Moral Philosophy called \u0027meta-ethics\u0027. Meta-ethics is a discussion of the nature of ethics. It is a second-order, reflective activity about ethics, and not a first-order discussion of the rights and wrongs of particular issues within ethics. Beginning with non-naturalism, the module proceeds to discuss emotivism, prescriptivism, descriptivism or naturalism, culminating in current discussion of moral realism.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"AS1-0201","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS1-0201","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS4-0118","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS4-0602","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
