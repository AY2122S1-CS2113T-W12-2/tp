{"moduleCode":"MUT4201","title":"Graduate Theory Preparation","description":"The module reviews key concepts and skills commonly assessed on graduate music school theory entrance exams. These include 4-part voice leading, 18th century contrapuntal techniques, post-tonal analysis, and common forms. This module assumes students are already familiar with these skills but are in need of reviewing them before entering graduate school. It is, therefore, appropriate for fourth year conservatory students whose future plans include graduate level studies in music.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"Pass any 3 of these modules: MUT2201, MUT2202, MUT2203, MUT2204 and MUT2205.
