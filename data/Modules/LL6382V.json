This course offers students a comprehensive overview of the foundations of private international law, with a particular focus on Singapore law. It covers private international law’s three main pillars - jurisdiction, choice of law and foreign judgments - and also touches on broader methodological issues, and questions of sovereignty, comity, and public policy, which undergird and define the boundaries of the field.","title":"Private International Law","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"LL6382V","aliases":["LL5382V","LL4382V"],"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Hybrid_D","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":10,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}],"fulfillRequirements":["LL4432","LL5432","LL6432","LL4432V","LL5432V","LL6432V","LLJ5432V"]}
