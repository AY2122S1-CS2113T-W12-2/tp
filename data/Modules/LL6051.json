{"moduleCode":"LL6051","title":"Principles Of Restitution","description":"This course introduces students to the central concepts and disputes in the law of restitution, centring on unjust enrichment as an organising theme.  The prevention of unjust enrichment as an independent legal principle, capable of founding causes of action, gained currency as an independent branch of the common law only as recently as in 1991.  This course covers the operation of key restitutionary concepts in common law and equity, including their relationships to the law of contract, torts, and property, as well as to equitable principles.  A selection of topics, which may vary from year to year, will be covered.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"(a) NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.
