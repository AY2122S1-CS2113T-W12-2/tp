{"moduleCode":"YHU3356","title":"Early Modern Empiricism","description":"This course focuses on the development of British Empiricism through the writings of John Locke, George Berkeley and David Hume. Taking the empiricist elements in Locke’s work as a point of departure, we explore how these elements are radically repurposed first by Berkeley and then by Hume to lay the foundations for what became known as early modern empiricism.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1430,"endTime":1600,"venue":"Y-CR16","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1430,"endTime":1600,"venue":"Y-CR16","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
