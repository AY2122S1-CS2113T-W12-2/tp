Leading approaches are re-examined in light of contextâ€? and cultureâ€?specific situations, and students' practical experience form a basis to engage with theoretical questions and issues of creating participatory theatre in nonâ€?conventional settings.","title":"Applied Theatre","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"TS1101E or GEM1003","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"TS3222","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["TS1101E","GEM1003"]}}
