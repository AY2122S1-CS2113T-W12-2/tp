{"moduleCode":"LL5432V","title":"International Litigation: Themes and Practice","description":"The subject of international litigation has gained strong recognition as a composite of two branches of the conflict of laws, namely jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgment. This conceptualisation brings into its embrace evolving themes of comity, proximity, efficiency, party autonomy, foreign sovereign immunity, foreign act of state and justiciability, reasonable extraterritoriality, and forum mandatory procedural policies. In this advanced course, each theme is studied in the context of practice in a particular sub-field of jurisdiction or enforcement; although some themes such as that of sovereignty are cross-cutting and are studied in more than one jurisdictional context.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.
