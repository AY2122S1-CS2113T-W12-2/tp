{"moduleCode":"CS5249","title":"Audio in Multimedia Systems","description":"This module aims at providing students with an in-depth understanding of modern audio technologies, ranging from low-level audio representation to high-level content analysis; and from basic waveform to advanced audio compression and compressed domain processing. Upon completion of this module, students should be able to perform research such as narrowing the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level concepts. Topics include: discretization, sampling, audio formats, audio synthesis, spatial audio, feature extraction, speech recognition, audio segmentation and summarization, source separation, and audio compression.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS1020 or its equivalent) and CS1231 and (MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1505C or MA1521) and (MA1101R or MA1506)","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
