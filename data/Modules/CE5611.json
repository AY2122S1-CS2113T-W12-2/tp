{"moduleCode":"CE5611","title":"Precast Concrete Technology","description":"The primary objective of this module is to equip civil engineering students with sufficient design knowledge and skills on precast structural concrete both for their\nfurther education and for their future engineering career. This module provides students with fundamental approaches in designing precast concrete components\nand structures. The students will acquire fundamental knowledge and approaches to section analysis and design, design of connections, floor diaphragm action,\nprecast frame structures and precast components. The module is targeted at MSc civil engineering students and those with a keen interest on precast concrete\ntechnology.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CE 3165 or CE4 standing or higher","preclusion":"CE5610 Precast and Retrofitting Technology (taken in Semester 2, AY2008/09 or earlier)\nTCE5611","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 25, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"EA-06-04","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120}]}]}
