{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This advanced seminar examines the intersections between law and resistance. We explore how resistance is conceptualized; the many faces of power; the power of law in coercion and repression, and the responses to power, including but not limited to resistance; how resistance emerges; various types of resistance, including individual, collective, uncoordinated, coordinated, hidden, and open forms; the role of law in tactics of resistance; the role of lawyers; and the efficacy of law in achieving social change. We explore these issues by reading classic and recent works, as well as discussing case studies selected and presented by students.","title":"Law and Resistance","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS4266","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YCC2121"}
