{"moduleCode":"EN5243","title":"The Birth of the Critic","description":"The module examines the role of criticism in the crucial period that had seen it evolve into a social institution: the long eighteenth century. It goes beyond tracing the early history of a critic-function to explore its relation to the emerging public sphere of civil society in which the so-called \u0027reading revolution\u0027 had taken place. Selected writings on two key literary figures, Shakespeare and Milton, are examined for the underlying discursive framework granting a critic powers to examine taste and virtue, forge a literary canon, and locate state-culture connections.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate student in the university or with the approval of the Department.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
