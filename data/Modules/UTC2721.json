{"moduleCode":"UTC2721","title":"Model and Systems Thinking for Complex Social Issues","description":"This module explores a 21st century world characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) by utilizing a synergy of model thinking and systems thinking. Why is segregation pervasive in society? Why are social riots sudden and abrupt? Why is environmental destruction irrational yet rational? From the catastrophes of nuclear meltdowns to financial crises, what role does risk and uncertainty play in our world? Students will approach such questions and evaluate complex social problems in the 21st century with models and systems concepts. Ultimately, this module seeks to expand the cognitive perception and enhance the systems thinking of its learners.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","preclusion":"UTC27%","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"RC4-SR3","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":16}]}]}
