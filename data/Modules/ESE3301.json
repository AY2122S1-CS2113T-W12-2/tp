{"moduleCode":"ESE3301","title":"Microbiology in Natural and Built Environments","description":"The module provides students with a strong foundation in environmental microbiology and its application to natural and engineered systems. The course addresses basic microbiological concepts and state-of-the-art environmental biotechnology. Microbial characteristics and function in terrestrial, aquatic environment and air are introduced to better understand biological processes. Microbial biogeochemical cycling of elements is examined with respect to nitrogen, carbon and sulphur. Aspects of molecular microbiology in environmental engineering are introduced with regard to applied biotechnologies. Also, urban microbiology and global emerging issues are introduced with respect to domestic and indoor microbiology, microbial contribution to climate changes, and current environmental issues.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"ESE2 standing or equivalent","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 27, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"EW2-03-14","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1300,"endTime":1400,"venue":"EA-06-02","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"02","startTime":1200,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EA-06-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"02","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"EW2-03-14","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"EA-06-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"01","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"EA-06-02","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
