{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Creative Nonfiction encompasses several artistic and exploratory practices. Students learn how to create nonfiction in authentic, innovative, and unexpected ways.  With readings, discussions, and in-class exercises, students practice shaping their ideas into inventive projects.  In this iteration of the course, students become familiar with diverse approaches to nonfiction, with special attention to literary journalism, personal narratives, and the audio essayâ€”an emerging form that uses sound as argument.  Students practice being critical readers, generate their own ideas, and use literary texts to comment on contemporary issues. This course welcomes newcomers as well as those with a background in the genre.","title":"Forms of Nonfiction: Literary Journalism from Print to Sound","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,6.5,3],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU3217","semesterData":[]}
