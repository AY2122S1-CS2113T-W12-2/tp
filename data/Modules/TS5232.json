{"moduleCode":"TS5232","title":"Performance, History and Cultural Memory","description":"How do societies use performance to mediate between the past and the present? This module addresses the question by considering the place of performance in the forging of history, the use of performance analysis as a means of gaining insights into historical events, and the function of performance as a process of remembering. Combining historical case studies and contemporary performances from local, regional and international contexts  from colonial encounters and memorial rituals to trauma plays   historiography is studied alongside the ways in which theatrical and other performances play a role in both reinforcing and challenging prevailing cultural memories.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate Student in the University or with the approval of the Department","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
