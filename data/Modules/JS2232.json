{"moduleCode":"JS2232","title":"Japan and Korea","description":"From the fifth century onwards, Japan has had an intricate and at times conflicting relationship with Korea. The formation of Japan’s modern and imperial culture was inseparable from its colonial experience in Korea: conversely, modernity in Korea was formed under Japanese colonialism. This module aims at understanding historical interrelations between Japan and Korea during colonial and postcolonial times by focusing on issues of modernity, national identity, cultural politics, and globalisation. It uses various official and popular cultural forms such as museums, expositions, art, film, anime, TV drama, and international events to study the intertwined histories between these two countries.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Japanese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
