{"moduleCode":"CE5883B","title":"Topics in Hydraulic \u0026 Water Resources –  Modelling Climate Change","description":"This course introduces the basic mathematical, statistical, physical, and chemical knowledge required to model the Earth’s climate system. Given the complexity of the system, theory of how to approximate equations and make them relevant over temporal and spatial scales is introduced. Through experimentation and hands on learning, students will learn to understand and build models of varying complexity describing the Earth and its Climate System. Finally, students will use and modify these models to perform their own studies on relevant questions.\nTopics include: Conservation equations; Dynamics; Thermodynamics, physics, chemistry; Radiative Forcing, Response, and Feedbacks; Coupling Across Scales; Non-linearities.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"UG: MA1505 and MA1506, or equivalents \nPG: Knowledge in Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, or Instructor Permission","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
