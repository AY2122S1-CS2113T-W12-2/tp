{"moduleCode":"EN4249","title":"Autotheory and Contemporary Autofiction","description":"This module seeks a critical understanding of the term “autotheory” (The Argonauts, 2015). It asks: What does the “auto” in the term imply? Does it signal a\nregression to the Self/Subject as already critiqued by theory in the 1980s? Or is it a reflection of a narcissism made possible today by social media apparatuses? Or\nelse, does it pave the way for a new “care for the self” (Foucault)? And how does it influence our readings of contemporary autofiction, and vice versa? Writers\nread in this module include Maggie Nelson, Paul Preciado, Yiyun Li, Rachel Cusk, and Ottessa Moshfegh.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
