{"moduleCode":"TEE3013","title":"Labview for Electrical Engineers","description":"This module will give students some general computing as well as more specific software skills for solving engineering problems. LabVIEW is widely adopted \nsoftware in the industry for data acquisition and instrument control. The teaching of LabVIEW will be based on engineering fundamentals that students have learnt in the first two years. This will also help them to consolidate concepts that have been learnt in the various technical modules. Through a series of integrated \nminiprojects carried out in the lab, students will be guided in their exploration of engineering principles and problem solving using the tools available in LabVIEW.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SCALE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"(TEE2021 or TEE2027) and TTG1401","preclusion":"EE3013E","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
