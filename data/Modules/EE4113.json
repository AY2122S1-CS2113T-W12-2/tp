{"moduleCode":"EE4113","title":"Digital Communications \u0026 Coding","description":"This course begins with a review of mathematical preliminaries such as random processes and signal space concepts. It covers the design of modulation and demodulation schemes for digital communications over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. Emphasis will be placed on error rate performance for various digital signaling techniques and on error control coding techniques for reliable communications.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"(EE2012A / ST2334) and EE3131C (for AY2019 intake \u0026 after); (EE2012 / ST2334) and EE3131C (for AY2018 intake \u0026 prior)","preclusion":"EE4102 or EE4103","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
