{"moduleCode":"NM5219R","title":"Critical Design","description":"The module explores, from a critical stance, various techniques of design thinking and user experience design in the context of emergent technologies and near future scenarios. Critical and speculative design practices, such as design fiction, action research and community-based technology and citizen science initiatives are employed to reflect upon new technologies through prototyping, storytelling and speculative design scenarios. These techniques bridge philosophical modes of inquiry and design practices, encouraging debate about the social, cultural and ethical impact of emerging and future technologies by exploring alternative futures and involving various actors and stakeholders in the decision making related to new technologies.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"NM4225 Speculative and Critical Design","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"AS6-0333","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}]}]}
