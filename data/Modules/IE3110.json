{"moduleCode":"IE3110","title":"Simulation","description":"This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modeling techniques, random number generators, discrete-event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyze and develop simulation models of given problems.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"IE2100 or DSC3215","preclusion":"DSC3221","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
