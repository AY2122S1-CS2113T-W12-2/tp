{"moduleCode":"SC2880A","title":"Singapore: The Social Experiment","description":"This module serves as a primer on Singapore society, covering its recent history and current issues. Students will get a good sense of what went into the construction of modern Singapore as a nation, an economy, and a home, as well as various policies and processes dealing with “deficits”, such as low fertility rates, afflicting Singapore. Whenever possible, students will have the opportunity to go on field?trips where they can get an immediate and better feel of the social changes taking place, through meeting the people — front?line, back office or board room — who routinely work in keeping Singapore going.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
