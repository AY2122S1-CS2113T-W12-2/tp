{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The accelerated, often rampant, growth of cities in Asia alters the quality of their inhabitantâ€™s lives, their ecological footprints and community bonds. Coping with urban growth affects not only those in the city; it affects also those in agricultural belts in rural peri-urban areas which are increasingly threatened by urban sprawl. \nThis module investigates various historical and economic forces shaping urban developments, identifies the elements of urbanism that have a direct impact on the environment (such as transport infrastructure) and offers insights into how sustainability principles can lead to new paradigms for urban rejuvenation and growth.","title":"Principles of Sustainable Urbanism","department":"SDE Dean's Office","faculty":"Design and Environment","workload":[2,1,0,0,7],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ISD5105","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2],"venue":"UTSRC-LT52","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2],"venue":"UT22-07-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2],"venue":"UTSRC-LT51","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"5","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2],"venue":"UT-AUD3","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2],"venue":"UTSRC-LT52","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2],"venue":"UT22-07-02","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1300","weeks":[1,2],"venue":"UT-AUD3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2],"venue":"UT22-07-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"5","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2],"venue":"UT-AUD1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2],"venue":"UTSRC-LT52","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
