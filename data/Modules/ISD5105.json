{"moduleCode":"ISD5105","title":"Principles of Sustainable Urbanism","description":"The accelerated, often rampant, growth of cities in Asia alters the quality of their inhabitant’s lives, their ecological footprints and community bonds. Coping with urban growth affects not only those in the city; it affects also those in agricultural belts in rural peri-urban areas which are increasingly threatened by urban sprawl. \nThis module investigates various historical and economic forces shaping urban developments, identifies the elements of urbanism that have a direct impact on the environment (such as transport infrastructure) and offers insights into how sustainability principles can lead to new paradigms for urban rejuvenation and growth.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SDE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Design and Environment","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"UTSRC-LT52","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"UT22-07-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"4","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"UTSRC-LT51","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"5","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"UT-AUD3","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"UTSRC-LT52","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"UT22-07-02","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"UT-AUD3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"UT22-07-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"5","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"UT-AUD1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"UTSRC-LT52","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
