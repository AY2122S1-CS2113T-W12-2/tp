{"moduleCode":"PC5203","title":"Advanced Solid State Physics","description":"This module aims to give graduate students additional training in the foundations of solid state physics and is intended to prepare them for research work and other graduate coursework modules. Topics to be covered include: translational symmetry and Bloch\u0027s theorem, rotational symmetry and group representation, electron-electron interaction and Hartree-Fock method, pseudopotential and LCAO schemes of energy band calculations, Boltzmann equation and thermoelectric phenomena, optical properties of semiconductors, insulators and metals, origin of ferromagnetism, models of Heisenberg, Stoner and Hubbard, Kondo effect. Berry phase and topological insulators.  Students are expected to read from a range of recommended and reference texts, and will be given an opportunity to present their reading as part of the regular lessons.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC3130 and PC4240 (Solid State Physics II) or Departmental Approval.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 23, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Hybrid_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":49},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Hybrid_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":49}]}]}
