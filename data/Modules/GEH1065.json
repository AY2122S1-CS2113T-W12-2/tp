As a social activity, art making involves elaborate cooperation among specialised personnel. Giving focus to visual art and using examples from Southeast Asia\nand beyond, topics covered include gender in the arts; governments, economies and religion in shaping the arts; artists and their art making as well as social dimensions of aesthetic experience and interpretation of art works.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Malay Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
