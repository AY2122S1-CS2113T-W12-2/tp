{"moduleCode":"MNO3301","title":"Organisational Behaviour","description":"This course deals with the study of human behavior in organisations: how people influence organisational events and how events within the organisation influence people\u0027s behaviour.  Organisational behavior is a field that draws ideas from psychology, social psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, and management and applies them to the organisation.  The field of organisational behaviour covers a wide range of topics: organisational culture, motivation, decision making, communication, work stress and so on.  In the end, the field of organisational behavior asks two questions: (1) why do people behave as they do within organisations? (2) how can we use this information to improve the effectiveness of the organisation?","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Management and Organisation","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"MNO1001 Management and Organisation or \nMNO1001X Management and Organisation or\nPL3239 Industrial and Organisational Psychology","preclusion":"BH3301 or BZ3501 or BK3309M or PS3243","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"A1","startTime":830,"endTime":1130,"venue":"BIZ1-0203","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":5},{"classNo":"A2","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"BIZ1-0203","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":5}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"A2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"BIZ1-0205","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40},{"classNo":"A1","startTime":830,"endTime":1130,"venue":"BIZ1-0205","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40}]}]}
