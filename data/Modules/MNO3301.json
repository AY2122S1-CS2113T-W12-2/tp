Organisational behavior is a field that draws ideas from psychology, social psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, and management and applies them to the organisation.  The field of organisational behaviour covers a wide range of topics: organisational culture, motivation, decision making, communication, work stress and so on.  In the end, the field of organisational behavior asks two questions: (1) why do people behave as they do within organisations? (2) how can we use this information to improve the effectiveness of the organisation?","title":"Organisational Behaviour","department":"Management and Organisation","faculty":"NUS Business School","workload":[3,0,0,4,3],"prerequisite":"MNO1001 Management and Organisation or \nMNO1001X Management and Organisation or\nPL3239 Industrial and Organisational Psychology","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MNO3301","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"A1","startTime":"0830","endTime":"1130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ1-0203","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":5,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"A2","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ1-0203","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":5,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"A2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ1-0205","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"A1","startTime":"0830","endTime":"1130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ1-0205","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["MNO1001","MNO1001X","PL3239"]}}
