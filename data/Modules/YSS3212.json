{"moduleCode":"YSS3212","title":"Chinese Politics","description":"China’s rise is arguably one of the most important features of the 21st Century. Its growth-driven model of single-party rule challenges democratic ideals nurtured since WWII and its growing international economic and political clout promises to transform the existing regional and international orders. How did China get to this point? Where is it going? This class explores China’s political and economic development beginning from the early Republican era, charts the Chinese Revolution, then turns to the Maoist and Reform eras in which it explores China’s transition from a closed and impoverished agriculture society to regional and world power.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","corequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
