{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course is interested in the recent turn to writing about illnesses – both physical and mental – in contemporary literature. It will examine how different styles or modes of narration have been deployed to contend or cope with illnesses. It will also look into how these narratives reflect the problematics of identity, subjectivity, ontology, existence, and community that illness brings with it. Writers read may include Woolf, Lorde, Sontag, Sedgwick, Cvetkovich, and Boyer.","title":"Sick Lit: Illness in Literature","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"(i) EN1101E AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","corequisite":"So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277).","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EN3880C","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["EN1101E",{"or":["EN2201","EN2202","EN2203","EN2204","EN2205","EN2207","EN2275","EN2276","EN2277"]}]}}
