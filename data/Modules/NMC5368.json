{"moduleCode":"NMC5368","title":"Media, Policy, and Markets","description":"Media policy has been a crucial instrument for governments to shape social and political climates, and more importantly, for organising global media industries within national boundaries. Nowadays, prolific personal social media and institutional media usage creates integral roles for media policy to play and administer. This module addresses the role of media policy from a transnational perspective in the contemporary digital media environment. Approaching policy from a perspective that emphasises the dynamics between the media industry and consumers enables it to investigate key parameters for producing, promoting,  distributing, exhibiting, and consuming media outside of technical policy development confinements.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2130,"venue":"AS7-0106","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
