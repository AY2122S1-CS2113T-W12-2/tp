{"moduleCode":"CS3103","title":"Computer Networks Practice","description":"This module aims to provide an opportunity for the students to learn commonly-used network protocols in greater technical depth with their implementation details than a basic networking course. Students will perform hands-on experiments in configuring and interconnecting LANs using networking devices/technologies (e.g., routers, switches, SDN switches, and hubs), networking protocols (e.g., DHCP, DNS, RIP, OSPF, ICMP, TCP, UDP, wireless LAN, VLAN protocols, SIP, SSL, IPSec-VPN) and networking tools (e.g, tcpdump, netstat, ping, traceroute). Students will learn higher-layer network protocols and develop network applications (client/server, P2P) via socket programming.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS2105 or EE3204/E or EE4204","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"5","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"6","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"7","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":20}]}]}
