{"moduleCode":"LI5204A","title":"Decision Support for Supply Chain","description":"This module explores the application of technology in\nlogistics and supply chains for optimization, simulation and\nmodelling to improve operational efficiency. Simulation\nmodelling enables logisticians and supply chain planners\nand managers to manage complexity, increase profitability\nand improve customer service to enhance\ncompetitiveness of the business. Topics covered include\nanalytics and simulation-based decision support systems\nfor logistics planning and supply chain management,\nstrategic supply chain network design, simulation and\noptimisation models for managing complexity, improving\nefficiency and increasing agility of the supply chain.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Logistics Inst - Asia Pac","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"LI5204 Supply Chain Simulation and Optimization","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
