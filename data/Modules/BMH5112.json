{"moduleCode":"BMH5112","title":"Negotiation \u0026 Dispute Resolution","description":"The course will highlight the components of effective negotiation and will also teach students to analyse their own behaviour in negotiations. The course will be largely experiential, providing students with the opportunity to develop their skills by participating in negotiations and integrating their experiences with the principles presented in the assigned readings and course discussions.\n\nThis course is designed to foster learning through doing, and to explore your own talents, skills, and shortcomings as a negotiator. The negotiation exercises will provide you with an opportunity to attempt strategies and tactics in a low-risk environment, to learn about yourself and how you respond in specific negotiation situations. If you discover a tendency that you think needs correction, this is the place to try something new. The course is sequenced so that cumulative knowledge can be applied and practiced.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","preclusion":"MNO3322, BMA5406, BMS5115, BMS5410","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
