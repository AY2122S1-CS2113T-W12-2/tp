{"moduleCode":"EE4109","title":"Spread Spectrum Communications","description":"Spread spectrum modulation is the enabling technology for many current mobile wireless communication systems and is a leading candidate for next generation communication systems. This module introduces students to spread spectrum communications, including modulation (direct-sequence and frequency hopping) and detection (single and multiuser). The topics covered also include wireless fading channels, sequence design (binary shift register sequences), sequence acquisition/tracking, cellular communications and the application of spread spectrum to Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Co-requisite: EE4102","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
