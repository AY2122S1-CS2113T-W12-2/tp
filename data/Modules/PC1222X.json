{"moduleCode":"PC1222X","title":"Fundamentals of Physics II","description":"The module aims to bridge the gap between O level Physics and first year university physics level. The module covers the fundamentals of three branches of physics: electricity \u0026 magnetism, optics and modern physics. Topics included in the part on electricity \u0026 magnetism are Coulombs law, electric field and potential, capacitance, current and resistance, DC circuits, magnetic fields, magnetic effects on current, electromagnetic induction, and electromagnetic waves. The part on optics encompasses topics such as reflection and refraction, systems of lenses, optical instruments, interference, diffraction, grating and polarization. Topics covered in the part on modern physics are blackbody radiation, photoelectric effect, atomic transitions and spectra, the uncertainty principle, wave-particle duality, radioactivity and decay processes, binding energy and fusion energy and fusion \u0026 fission.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"\u0027O\u0027 level pass in Physics or Combined Science (Physics \u0026 Chemistry OR Physics \u0026 Biology) or its equivalent","preclusion":"\u0027A\u0027 level or H2 pass in Physics or PC1222 or PC1143, or PC1144 or PC1432 or PC1432X","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
