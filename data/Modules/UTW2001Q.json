{"moduleCode":"UTW2001Q","title":"\u0027What\u0027s in a word?\u0027 Meaning across cultures","description":"It is often assumed that there is a common understanding of what specific words mean. However, can one assume a common understanding across cultures of words describing colour, such as \u0027red\u0027 or \u0027maroon,\u0027 or emotion, such as \u0027happiness,\u0027 \u0027pleasure,\u0027 or \u0027disgust\u0027? Are forms of address, such as nicknames, or interjections, such as \u0027damn\u0027 or the \u0027F\u0027 word, used in similar ways across cultures? Are there differences between the ways that speakers of different varieties of English understand the meanings of such words? This module explores how meaning is culture-bound, and helps students understand cultural differences in the choice and use of words.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"I\u0026E I","preclusion":"(i)\tUSP students may read any I\u0026E module, but not in lieu of a Writing and Critical Thinking module.\n(ii)\tStudents who have already read an I\u0026E II module.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"TC-SR6","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"RC4-SR6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"4","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"TC-SR6","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"4","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"CAPT-SR5","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"RC4-SR6","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15}]}]}
