{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"DSC3221, IE3110E","description":"This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modelling techniques, random number generators, discrete event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyse and develop simulation models of given problems.","title":"Simulation","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","workload":[3,1,0.5,4,4],"corequisite":"TIE2100/DSC3215, IE2100E","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"TIE3110","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":65,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"2030","endTime":"2130","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":65,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-11-25T09:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
