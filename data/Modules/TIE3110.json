{"moduleCode":"TIE3110","title":"Simulation","description":"This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modelling techniques, random number generators, discrete event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyse and develop simulation models of given problems.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"SCALE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","preclusion":"DSC3221, IE3110E","corequisite":"TIE2100/DSC3215, IE2100E","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 25, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"3","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":65},{"classNo":"2","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2030,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":65}]}]}
