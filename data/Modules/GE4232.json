{"moduleCode":"GE4232","title":"Global Political Ecologies","description":"This module explores the relationships between politics (broadly defined) and the environment at a global level. Global political ecologies will examine environmental issues that have explicit global impact. It is also interested in issues that have comparatively less global impact but are nonetheless considered “global” because they are endemic in many places around the world. Drawing on the theoretical underpinnings of political ecology and case studies around the world, this module will explore themes such as: environmental ideology and discourse; politics and livelihoods; energy and natural resource management; production and consumption of food, nature conservation and climate change.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GE with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track\n\n(BES students from both specialisations).\nCompleted 80 MCs of NUS modules before they can read any level-4000 GE modules.
