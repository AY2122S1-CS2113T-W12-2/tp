{"moduleCode":"MLE3101A","title":"Materials Characterization","description":"Being able to characterize the structure of materials over length scales ranging from millimetres to angstroms, is a fundamental skill for all Materials Scientists \u0026 Engineers. It is vital that Materials Scientists \u0026 Engineers are trained in selecting the most appropriate materials characterization technique for a given application. This requires mastering the operational principles behind a wide range of techniques to interpret their data. This includes: SEM, TEM, XRD, surface characterization, optical spectroscopy and thermal analysis. This will be illustrated in case studies from identifying the secrets of new materials to failure analysis. This module complements the lab based MLE3101.","moduleCredit":3.0,"department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"MLE2102","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
