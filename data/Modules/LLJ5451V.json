It will concentrate on topics as diverse as territorial acquisition and religious authority (the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas), on the freedom of the oceans and the slave trade, on colonies and race. The course will also be of particular interest to modalities of accountability for the international legal past, such as the 2000 Womenâ€™s International Tribunal on Sexual Violence and the recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in the Chagos Archipelago.","title":"An Uncensored History of International Law","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","workload":"0-3--0-0-7","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"LLJ5451V","semesterData":[]}
