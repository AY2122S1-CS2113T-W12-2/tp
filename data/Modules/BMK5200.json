{"moduleCode":"BMK5200","title":"Pricing Analytics","description":"Successful pricing strategy is a key to successful business. This module is designed to introduce the concepts, techniques, and latest thinking on pricing issues. The overall emphasis is not about the theory but the practice of pricing, although theoretical foundations will not be overlooked. This module is less about the mechanics of setting a price – it is more about understanding the process of formulating pricing strategies and making pricing decisions. In line with the current trend in pricing practice, we focus on pricing-related data analytics methods and cases.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
