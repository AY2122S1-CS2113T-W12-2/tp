The module begins with a birds-eye view of organ systems and their integration, organized around a limited number of simplifying themes.  Deeper explorations will be made into a small number of human adaptations, exploring selection, maladaptation to modern living, and human variation.  The module is intended to be accessible to students for whom this is their first college-level science course and to be of value to anyone interested in human biology, regardless of major.","title":"Human Biology","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[1,3,0,0,8.5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC2234","semesterData":[]}
