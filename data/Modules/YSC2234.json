{"moduleCode":"YSC2234","title":"Human Biology","description":"This module examines selected aspects of human anatomy and physiology from an evolutionary framework.  The module begins with a birds-eye view of organ systems and their integration, organized around a limited number of simplifying themes.  Deeper explorations will be made into a small number of human adaptations, exploring selection, maladaptation to modern living, and human variation.  The module is intended to be accessible to students for whom this is their first college-level science course and to be of value to anyone interested in human biology, regardless of major.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","preclusion":"YSC1201 Human Biology, LSM2212, LSM3212","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
