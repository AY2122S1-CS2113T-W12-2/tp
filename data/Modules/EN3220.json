{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Epic, romance, drama, novel, film, and TV: each symbolizes and defines a specific era in Britain, an era that is that formâ€™s own â€œgolden age.â€? What is at stake (politically, artistically, and epistemically) in describing, for instance, the 19th century as the â€œage of the novelâ€? rather than as the â€œage of dramaâ€?? As we examine this epochizing of artforms, weâ€™ll explore transformations in story and pleasure from the Medieval period to the present, and weâ€™ll consider the changing roles of genre and medium in the internet and DH era. Texts include Beowulf, Doctor Faustus, Pride and Prejudice, Great Expectations.","title":"From the â€œAge of Epicâ€? to the â€œAge of TVâ€?","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"(i) EN1101E AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","corequisite":"So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277).","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EN3220","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":{"and":["EN1101E",{"or":["EN2201","EN2202","EN2203","EN2204","EN2205","EN2207","EN2275","EN2276","EN2277"]}]}}
