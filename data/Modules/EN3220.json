{"moduleCode":"EN3220","title":"From the “Age of Epic” to the “Age of TV”","description":"Epic, romance, drama, novel, film, and TV: each symbolizes and defines a specific era in Britain, an era that is that form’s own “golden age.” What is at stake (politically, artistically, and epistemically) in describing, for instance, the 19th century as the “age of the novel” rather than as the “age of drama”? As we examine this epochizing of artforms, we’ll explore transformations in story and pleasure from the Medieval period to the present, and we’ll consider the changing roles of genre and medium in the internet and DH era. Texts include Beowulf, Doctor Faustus, Pride and Prejudice, Great Expectations.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"(i) EN1101E AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","corequisite":"So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277).","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
