{"moduleCode":"CS5461","title":"Algorithmic Mechanism Design","description":"Recent years have seen a dramatic rise in the use of\nalgorithms for solving problems involving strategic\ndecision makers. Deployed algorithms now assist in a\nvariety of economic interactions: assigning medical\nresidents to schools, allocating students to courses,\nallocating security resources in airports, allocating\ncomputational resources and dividing rent. We will\nexplore foundational topics at the intersection of\neconomics and computation, starting with the foundations\nof game theory: Nash equilibria, the theory of cooperative\ngames, before proceeding to covering more advanced\ntopics: matching algorithms, allocation of indivisible goods,\nand mechanism design.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"(CS2010 or CS2020 or CS2040 or its equivalent) and ((MA1100 or (CS1231 or its equivalent)) and \n(MA1101R or MA1311 or MA1508E or MA1513) and \n(EE2012/A or MA2216 or ST2131 or ST2334)","preclusion":"CS4261","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 23, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"G1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":110},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2030,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":110}]}]}
