{"moduleCode":"UD5628","title":"Critique of Contemporary Urban Design","description":"This module aims to guide students through a critical assessment of contemporary urban design. In the face of accelerating technological advancement, exacerbating environmental degradation, and in particular unexpected threats such as the Covid-19 pandemic, our cities are confronted with many emerging issues. This raises great challenges that requires us to re-think and re-conceptualise urban design practices at present and in the future. Based on examination of the latest debates and discussions on the emerging issues of contemporary cities, and conversation with experts from practices, government agencies, academia, etc., this module will provide students with a multi-perspective platform for them to develop their own critical views and convictions of the design and building of future cities.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1400,"venue":"NAK-AUD","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"SDE-ER4","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}]}]}
