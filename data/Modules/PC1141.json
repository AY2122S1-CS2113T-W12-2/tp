{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"STUDENTS WHO HAVE PASSED PC1431 OR PC1431FC or PC1431X OR PC1433 ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE THIS MODULE.","description":"This module presents the fundamental principles of classical mechanics. It covers such topics as kinematics, Galilean transformation, Newton's laws of motion, dynamics of a particle with generalization to many particle systems, conservation laws, collisions, angular momentum and torque, motion of a rigid body, gravitation and planetary motion, static equilibrium, oscillatory motion and vibrational modes, waves, Doppler's effect and fluid mechanics. The module also has a practical component consisting of five experiments designed to enhance students' understanding of some of the concepts discussed in lectures. This module is targeted at science students who wish to acquire a working knowledge of mechanics, and is an essential for physics majors.","title":"Introduction to Classical Mechanics","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,0.5,1.5,2,3],"prerequisite":"â€˜A' level or H2 pass in Physics or PC1221/PC1221FC/PC1221X & PC1222/PC1222X","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC1141","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":[{"or":["PC1221","PC1221FC","PC1221X"]},{"or":["PC1222","PC1222X"]}]},"fulfillRequirements":["PC2132","PC2193","PC2288","PC2289"]}
