{"moduleCode":"PC1141","title":"Introduction to Classical Mechanics","description":"This module presents the fundamental principles of classical mechanics. It covers such topics as kinematics, Galilean transformation, Newton\u0027s laws of motion, dynamics of a particle with generalization to many particle systems, conservation laws, collisions, angular momentum and torque, motion of a rigid body, gravitation and planetary motion, static equilibrium, oscillatory motion and vibrational modes, waves, Doppler\u0027s effect and fluid mechanics. The module also has a practical component consisting of five experiments designed to enhance students\u0027 understanding of some of the concepts discussed in lectures. This module is targeted at science students who wish to acquire a working knowledge of mechanics, and is an essential for physics majors.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"‘A\u0027 level or H2 pass in Physics or PC1221/PC1221FC/PC1221X \u0026 PC1222/PC1222X","preclusion":"STUDENTS WHO HAVE PASSED PC1431 OR PC1431FC or PC1431X OR PC1433 ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE THIS MODULE.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
