{"moduleCode":"ME6608","title":"Material processing of cell","description":"Cellular solids refer to materials that contain cavities, channels or interstices, which are widespread in nature and engineering. Engineering cellular solids, including honeycombs, foams and lattice structures, can be made from nearly any type of materials: ceramics, polymers, metals and composites. Their cellular structure gives rise to a unique combination of structural and functional properties, which are highly dependent on their manufacturing process. This module aims at introducing the process-structure-properties relationship of cellular solids. The manufacturing process of cellular solids for different functional and structural applications will be introduced.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Hybrid_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
