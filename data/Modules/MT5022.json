{"moduleCode":"MT5022","title":"Digital Disruption and Technology Strategy","description":"This course introduces students/engineers to digital strategies. Even though companies have been subject to successive shocks such as the industrial and computing revolutions, technology and innovation management has remained critical for their product strategy, differentiation, and competitiveness. Today, however, digital corporations (e.g. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba, Uber, Netflix, Bitcoin…) are changing this status quo and revolutionizing business. They have few products but many services, and they connect people to one another. This module introduces students to digital strategies and prepares them to think of innovation in a digital context, and export this to their organizations to engage in disruptive transformation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90}]}]}
