{"moduleCode":"CDM5104","title":"Introduction to Bioinformatics for Metagenomics","description":"This module is designed for biology students who have no prior background in bioinformatics. Students will learn about the latest analysis strategies and techniques for identifying gene loci and predicting gene function from unknown DNA sequences, in the context of metagenomics. They will also learn how to solve real biological challenges using convential online bioinformatics tools (i.e. no programming) such as BLAST or gene onthology. At the end of the course, students will have a solid foundation in sequence analysis and sequence annotation.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"NUS Medicine Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
