Firms stand to gain efficiencies from digitally supporting their existing\nprocesses. Incumbent and new businesses are leveraging these technologies to upend existing processes and sectors altogether. We will take a three step approach: First, we will develop frameworks that enable us to evaluate digitization opportunities.
