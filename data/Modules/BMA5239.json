{"moduleCode":"BMA5239","title":"Digitization for Business Model Innovation","description":"Digitization – e.g. machine learning, AI, automation – is transforming how firms operate. Firms stand to gain efficiencies from digitally supporting their existing\nprocesses. Incumbent and new businesses are leveraging these technologies to upend existing processes and sectors altogether. We will take a three step approach: First, we will develop frameworks that enable us to evaluate digitization opportunities. Second, we will gain hands on experience with some  digital/analytical tools such as social media analytics. Third, a bolder step, we will develop an action plan for how you can leverage these technologies for business model innovation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
