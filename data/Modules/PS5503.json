{"moduleCode":"PS5503","title":"Decentralization and Local Governance","description":"During the past 30 to 40 years, decentralization of government has been at the heart of political and public policy discourse in many countries. At the same time, in other countries, decentralized arrangements have been recentralized. Thus, the\nreal-world policy issue is not limited to decentralization, but embraces its opposite—centralization—and the pros and cons of these reforms have been widely debated. This seminar will cover timely and vibrant topics of decentralization/centralization from theoretical and empirical perspectives. These topics include but are not limited to fiscal federalism, political decentralization, sectoral decentralization, the association between decentralization and corruption.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Students must have basic proficiency in interpreting findings of quantitative and qualitative research.
