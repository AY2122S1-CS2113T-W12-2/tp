{"moduleCode":"YSC3213","title":"Experimental Physics Laboratory","description":"Experimental physics will provide students with hands?on practical experience using techniques to investigate scientific problems that draw on concepts from different branches of physics (e.g. quantum, statistical, thermal, solid state and optical). It aims to enhance their understanding and apply scientific knowledge learnt in class. Emphasis will also be placed on the development of analytical skills in measurement and analysis.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC1207 General Chemistry or YSC1213 General Physics or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
