{"moduleCode":"SC2209","title":"Money, Business and Social Networks","description":"This module adopts a practical approach to understanding the changing value of human life alongside changing meanings and uses of money over the past decades, and also how these have led to the emergence of dominant organizations and networks – in both the public and private sectors – whose operations have significantly shaped perceptions and practices of family, gender, leisure, the state, and work. Students will explore how money as a basis for the rationalization of social life presents varying contradictory processes that shape choices on education, employment, social relations, rationality and national identity, cultural heritage and self-identity.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
