{"moduleCode":"EE2022","title":"Electrical Energy Systems","description":"With the increasing concern of the environmental pollution and related global warming problems, there is a renewed   interest in understanding of electrical power and energy systems. Thus, there is an apparent need for an introductory course on electrical energy systems for electrical engineering students. In view of this need, this course has been designed to provide an overview of traditional energy sources, electrical energy generation, transmission, distribution and utilization systems. The concepts of renewable energy sources, distributed renewable energy generation and smart-grid structure are introduced. The key issues of energy requirement in portable electronic computing system and wireless energy transfer are covered.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"EE2111A Electrical Engineering Principles and Practice II / EE1111B Electrical \u0026 Computer Engineering Principles and Practice","preclusion":"EE2029 Introduction to Electrical Energy Systems, EE3506C Intro to Elect Energy Systems","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
