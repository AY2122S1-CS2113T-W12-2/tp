{"moduleCode":"CS4347","title":"Sound and Music Computing","description":"This module introduces the fundamental technologies employed in Sound and Music Computing focusing on three major categories: speech, music, and environmental sound. This module introduces the concept of sound and its representations in the analog and digital domains, as well as in time and frequency domains. Moreover, this module provides hands-on instruction on relevant machine learning tools, and an in-depth review of related technologies in sound data analytics (Automatic Speech Recognition, Automatic Music Transcription and Sound Event Detection) leading to a group project. Topics in sound synthesis, automatic music generation and music information retrieval will be covered for breadth.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS2108 and \n(MA1101R or MA1311 or MA1508E or MA1513) and \n(MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1507 or (MA1511 and MA1512) or MA1521)","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"COM1-0212","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1300,"venue":"COM1-0209","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1300,"endTime":1400,"venue":"COM1-0209","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"COM1-0209","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1500,"endTime":1600,"venue":"COM1-0209","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
