{"moduleCode":"EN2277","title":"Love\u0027s Word: Reading across Literature and Philosophy","description":"As stories are told at a dinner-party, Socrates claims, the “only thing I know is the art of love”. How are the arts of knowledge, erôs, and story-telling related? From Plato to Freud, love inspires creative thought while putting at risk rational argumentation, conscious will, and the orderly relation of body, self, and society. Dispersed into another’s life-story or incorporated into the body as loss or pain, erotic yearning requires a style of reflection; in turn, reflection is not only disturbed but aroused by feeling. Students will read for the convergence, differences and traffic between literary, philosophical and critical texts.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"EN1101E","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
