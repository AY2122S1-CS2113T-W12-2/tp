{"moduleCode":"HY3263","title":"Imperialism and Anti-Colonialism in South Asia","description":"This module will study political ideologies that served to legitimize colonial control in South Asia as well as the struggles against them. Through a series of case studies that focus on a range of issues, students will gain a better understanding of how imperialist discourses categorized and hierarchized communities on the basis of conceptions of religion, masculinity, supposed propensity to violence and hyper-sexuality. Students will also engage with revolutionary ideologies developed by anti-colonial figures and their differing approaches towards shaping national regeneration. The module will highlight and discuss the legacy of these contestations and debates in contemporary South Asia.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
