Comprising qualitative and quantitative elements, this module will hone students’ ability to engage in Systems Thinking: understanding parts of a system, seeing interconnections, asking ‘what-if’ questions, quantifying the\neffects of specific interventions and using such understanding to propose operational/structural policies courageously and creatively. Interactive discussions and hands-on computer modelling using examples from several ecological and natural resource systems will serve as the primary learning mechanisms.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","preclusion":"GEM1914 or GEM1915% or GEM1918 or GEM1919 or GET1011 or UTC1411 or UTC1702% or UTC1701 or UTC1700","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
