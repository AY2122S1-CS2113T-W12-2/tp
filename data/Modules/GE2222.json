{"moduleCode":"GE2222","title":"Politics and Space","description":"This module introduces students to the major thematic concerns that have\ntraditionally shaped political geography as a sub?discipline. It also allows students to engage with emerging issues that are likely to become focal points in shaping future debates among political geographers. The aim of the module is to explore the co?constitutive relationship between politics and space. As the political organization of society has spatial consequences, so too does geography influence our understanding of political relationships. These relations are negotiated and contested in multiple ways that cut across different locations, scales, and temporalities. Accordingly, we will examine political concerns, disputes, accommodations, and consequences from a geographical perspective, where students can expect to acquire a critical appreciation for the historical  trajectories and evolving implications of states, sovereignty, territoriality, nationalism,  colonialism, democracy, ethnic conflict, policing and crime, terrorism, war, environmental justice, and political activism.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
