{"moduleCode":"SE3222","title":"Gender in Southeast Asia","description":"What are the experiences of men and women during the pre-colonial, colonial and contemporary eras in Southeast Asia? How are gender identities and roles constructed? How do the interplays between local cultures, class, ethnicity, economy, politics and religion affect power relations between men and women in both the private and public spheres? Using interdisciplinary approaches, this module will examine these questions via recent literature, ethnographic studies, life histories, films and other audio-visual documentaries concerning men and women in different parts of the Southeast Asian region.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 4, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS1-0304","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS3-0304","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS1-0205","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
