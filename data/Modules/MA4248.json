{"moduleCode":"MA4248","title":"Theoretical Mechanics","description":"Formerly MA3224 Theoretical MechanicsThis course develops the Newtonian, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics starting from basic concepts of affine geometry and Newton\u0027s three laws as recast in a logical way, where the concepts of mass and force are shown to be derived from the symmetry properties characteristic of empirical measurements. Major topics: Motion in a central force field and Kepler\u0027s three laws of planetary motion, D\u0027Alembert\u0027s principle of virtual work, Lagrange\u0027s equations of motion, Legendre transformations and Hamilton\u0027s equations of motion, geodesics description of inertial motion, Euler\u0027s equation for rigid body motion, Noether\u0027s theorem, canonical transformations, and the Hamilton-Jacobi equations.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA2108 or MA2108S or MA2212 or PC2212","preclusion":"MA3224.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
