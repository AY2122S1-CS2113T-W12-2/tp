{"moduleCode":"LSM4267","title":"Light \u0026 Vision in Animal Communication","description":"Animals rely on various sensory systems to detect environmental information; a common mode involves light detection. Many rely on visual stimuli for numerous behavioural activities; humans often fail to understand these light signals. This module will introduce: (i) the fundamentals of light detection, (ii) the instrumentation and software involved in accurate detection, quantification/characterisation of animal/plant light signals, (iii) the formulation of hypotheses in animal-animal and animal-plant visual communication from interdisciplinary sciences (e.g. behaviour, conservation, optics), and (iv) relevant industrial applications. This module will also visit some other systems beyond the visible light spectrum, for example: infrared reception and thermoreception.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"LSM3267 Behavioural Biology","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
