{"moduleCode":"ESE5880C","title":"Topics in Env. Eng. - Environ Sys Planning \u0026 Analysis","description":"This module introduces students to the planning and evaluation of environmental protection systems,which are typically capital intensive and require high operational and maintenance costs. The impact associatedwith uncertainty of environmental inputs and variability in operating conditions (which will inevitably occur) on environmental protection systems, approaches to manage such uncertainty/variability, engineering tools for planning environmental protection systems and evaluating the effectiveness of these systems along with capacity management will be discussed. This module will enable students to acquire skills useful for planning, analysing, designing and managing capital intensive environmental protection systems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":70}]}]}
