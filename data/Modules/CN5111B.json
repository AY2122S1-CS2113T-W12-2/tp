{"moduleCode":"CN5111B","title":"Process Optimization with Industrial Applications","description":"Students will learn fundamentals, methods, and software for formulating and solving optimization problems related to chemical engineering. They will study various methods of linear/nonlinear and unconstrained/constrained programming, which would enable them to select and use appropriate solution algorithms and/or software for solving a given problem. Guest lecturer with extensive industrial experience in the optimization area will discuss many case studies in reality, to demonstrate how these theoretical tools can be used.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Calculus, linear algebra and numerical methods at undergraduate level","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
