{"moduleCode":"CG4002","title":"Computer Engineering Capstone Project","description":"This module introduces students to the development of a large system from conceptualisation to its final implementation. It is structured to contain substantial design and development of hardware and software components.\nThis module is the culminating point of a series of modules integrating the theories which students have already learnt in CS1010, CS2040C, CG2028, CG2271 and CS2113/T. With this capstone project, students would be able to better appreciate the relevance of the various components in the Computer Engineering curriculum to large scale computer engineering projects.","moduleCredit":8.0,"department":"Computing and Engineering Programme","faculty":"Multi Disciplinary Programme","prerequisite":"CG2028 Computer Organization and CG2271 Real-Time Operating Systems and CS2113/T Software Engineering \u0026 Object-Oriented Programming","preclusion":"CG3002 Embedded Systems Design Project\nEE3032 Innovation \u0026 Enterprise II\nEE3208 Embedded Computer Systems Design","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"COM1-0206","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"02","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"COM1-0206","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"COM1-0206","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"02","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"COM1-0206","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}]}]}
