{"moduleCode":"YSC1218","title":"Molecular Perspectives","description":"This course will incorporate a story-telling approach, accessible to non-science majors, to illustrate the evolution of fundamental ideas about atoms and molecules. The impact of chemistry on history and our modern day lives will be discussed in term of key discoveries and the scientists who made them. Topics such as thermodynamics, kinetics, stereochemistry, organic synthesis, spectroscopy, and molecular modelling will be covered in a palatable manner using examples drawn from medicine, polymers, natural products, etc.","moduleCredit":2.5,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
