{"moduleCode":"UHB2207","title":"Language, Cognition, and Culture","description":"This module explores the deep interconnections between language, cognition and culture. It begins with a consideration of the ‘discursive mind’ - that is, the particularly human way of knowing that uses language as its primary tool and medium. Realizing how much of human cognition is language-dependant,\nwe then explore the relations between language, cognition and culture by looking at such everyday linguistic phenomena as code-switching, metaphor and gesture. Augmenting the reading of sociolinguistic and cognitive science texts in this module, students will also learn how to collect and to analyze empirical\nevidence of language phenomena in order to more critically assess the claims of such texts.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","preclusion":"Not applicable to USP modules.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30}]}]}
