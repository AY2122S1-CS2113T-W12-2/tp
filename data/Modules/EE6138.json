{"moduleCode":"EE6138","title":"Optimization for Electrical Engineering (Advanced)","description":"The module exposes students to a variety of techniques to formulate and solve optimization problems for applications in electrical and computer engineering. The topics include convex sets, convex functions, convex optimization problems (including both linear and nonlinear formulations), duality and KKT optimality conditions, numerical algorithms for both unconstrained and constrained optimization problems, and selected examples from applications in electrical engineering.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"EE5138 Optimization for Electrical Engineering\nOr EE5138R Optimization for Communication Systems","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E1-06-09","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":15}]}]}
