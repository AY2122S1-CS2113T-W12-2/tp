{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"MA3266","description":"Fourier analysis occupies a central position in both pure and applied mathematics. This module introduces some of the main ideas of Fourier analysis while trying to keep the technical prerequisites to a minimum. In particular, Lebesgue integration is not required. Selected applications to approximation problems are presented. Main topics: Fourier series, summability, pointwise and mean square convergence of Fourier series. Fejer’s Theorem, localization principle and Dini’s test. Applications: Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, orthogonal polynomials, mean square approximation, best uniform polynomial approximation.","title":"Fourier Analysis and Approximation","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"(MA2101 or MA2101S) and (MA2108 or MA2108S)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MA4229","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0512","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0512","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0405","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-06T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":150}],"prereqTree":{"and":[{"or":["MA2101","MA2101S"]},{"or":["MA2108","MA2108S"]}]},"fulfillRequirements":["MA5241","MA5242"]}
