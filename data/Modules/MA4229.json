{"moduleCode":"MA4229","title":"Fourier Analysis and Approximation","description":"Fourier analysis occupies a central position in both pure and applied mathematics. This module introduces some of the main ideas of Fourier analysis while trying to keep the technical prerequisites to a minimum. In particular, Lebesgue integration is not required. Selected applications to approximation problems are presented. Main topics: Fourier series, summability, pointwise and mean square convergence of Fourier series. Fejer’s Theorem, localization principle and Dini’s test. Applications: Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, orthogonal polynomials, mean square approximation, best uniform polynomial approximation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"(MA2101 or MA2101S) and (MA2108 or MA2108S)","preclusion":"MA3266","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 6, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"S17-0512","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"S17-0512","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1000,"venue":"S17-0405","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}]}]}
