{"moduleCode":"SC3219","title":"Sexuality in Comparative Perspective","description":"Sex, sexuality and sexual orientations are cultural forms rather than purely \"natural\" states. This course examines the variety of social dimensions that shape human sexuality.  A range of theoretical perspectives and cross-cultural comparisons are drawn in order to unravel the complexities of sexualities and to see how sexualities are shaped by historical norms, social scripts, political structures, global forces and commodification. Students are required to read historical materials, anthropological research and be familiar with political economy and social constructionist paradigms.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS3-0309","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS4-0116","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS5-0309","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
