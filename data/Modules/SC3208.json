{"moduleCode":"SC3208","title":"Religion in Society \u0026 Culture","description":"This course concerns the observable phenomena of religion as lived by ordinary people. Analysing religion as part of human knowledge, we grapple with the meanings of the universe, suffering, self, choice and ethics. Comparing systems of symbolic thought, ritual action and moral imagination, we understand societies in terms of their own knowledge, practices, values and interests. We draw from\nvaried religious traditions including world religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam), indigenous traditions (shamanism, animism, ancestor-worship, folk religion), new religious movements and secular humanism. We engage with the interactions between piety, power and productivity in constituting social structures and producing human agency.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 29, 2022, 2:30:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS4-0206","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS4-0206","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS5-0202","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS3-0215","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
