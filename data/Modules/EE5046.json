{"moduleCode":"EE5046","title":"Renewable energy sources","description":"Most commonly used renewable energy sources such as Solar PV and Wind will be introduced. Their potential for each region and how to calculate the yield will be demonstrated. The economics of the renewable source for a region will be calculated and discussed. It will give the reader tools to assess the renewable energy potential and to choose the best renewable energy mix for support. It will also characterize the nature of the power generated by such source which have variability and uncertainty. Methods to forecast the possible yield will be discussed.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
