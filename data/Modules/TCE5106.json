{"moduleCode":"TCE5106","title":"Ground Improvement","description":"This is an advanced module on ground improvement\ntechniques as well as its design, construction and\nmonitoring in geotechnical engineering. Topics covered\ninclude ground improvement principles and design\nconsiderations, techniques of improving granular soils,\ntechniques of improving cohesive soils and peaty soils, field\ncontrols and monitoring, field evaluation – specification,\nperformance evaluation and acceptance criteria, and case\nstudy. Student are taught the basic principles of various\nground improvement techniques, and how to select the\nmost appropriate ground improvement techniques to be\nused in specific circumstances. Specific learning objectives\ninclude understanding the principles and design of vibroflotation\nmethod, dynamic compaction, dynamic\nreplacement with mixing, vertical drains with preloading,\nchemical stabilization and grouting, etc. Field construction\ncontrol and instrumentation as well as monitoring\ntechniques will be discussed","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SCALE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"TCE2112","preclusion":"CE5106","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
