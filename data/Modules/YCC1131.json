{"moduleCode":"YCC1131","title":"Scientific Inquiry 1","description":"Scientific Inquiry 1 considers how scientists think by looking into a well-established topic: evolution. Students explore the evidence for biological evolution from fossils to the recent revolution in genetics. The idea of evolution and the related idea of natural selection highlight fundamental differences between science and other ways of knowing. Although evolution is well-supported scientifically, it is still doubted by a large fraction of humanity. In this course, we approach the topic as a scientist would, identifying and interpreting the relevant evidence through a scientific lens.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
