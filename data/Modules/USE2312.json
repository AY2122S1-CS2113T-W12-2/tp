{"moduleCode":"USE2312","title":"Nationalism and the Arts","description":"What makes diverse people a nation? Though no single answer covers all nations or nationalisms, analysts agree that modern nations are less a natural formation than a construction in need of constant upkeep. Art can and does play a role here. This module introduces several theories of nationalism and of art on the understanding that these discourses do not mesh easily.
