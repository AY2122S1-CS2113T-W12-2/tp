{"moduleCode":"PS4881G","title":"Topics in CP: Politics of the Korean Peninsula","description":"This module offers an introduction to key issues in Korean politics. We cover the politics of both regimes on the Korean Peninsula, as well as inter-Korean relations. Although the module focuses on the domestic politics of Korea, the peninsula\u0027s politics cannot be understood without reference to the broader regional and international context. The module therefore bridges comparative polticics and international relations.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in PS or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
