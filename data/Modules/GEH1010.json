In other words, what is a â€œtigerâ€? when it is not just a zoo animal but one that lives in a forest next to your home? In this introductory and interdisciplinary course to conservation and the environment, we will watch films and discuss novels and ethnographies focusing on human/animal relations in six different spheres: Mountains, Deserts, Rivers, Plains, Forests, and Sea. The course aims to be an informative, provocative and fun introduction to an exciting and relatively new field of scholarship.","title":"Beasts, People and Wild Environments in South Asia","department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEH1010","attributes":{"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT8","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":0,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-04-30T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
