{"moduleCode":"GEH1010","title":"Beasts, People and Wild Environments in South Asia","description":"How do ideas about big beasts and the wild inform our socio?cultural worldview? In other words, what is a “tiger” when it is not just a zoo animal but one that lives in a forest next to your home? In this introductory and interdisciplinary course to conservation and the environment, we will watch films and discuss novels and ethnographies focusing on human/animal relations in six different spheres: Mountains, Deserts, Rivers, Plains, Forests, and Sea. The course aims to be an informative, provocative and fun introduction to an exciting and relatively new field of scholarship.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"GEM1913","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 30, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS4-0115","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT8","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS3-0307","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"D2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS3-0309","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS3-0309","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
