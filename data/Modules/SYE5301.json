{"moduleCode":"SYE5301","title":"Humans and Systems Engineering","description":"This module will focus on the interaction dynamics between the human operator and the machine/system in a human-machine system. We shall begin by defining the areas of concern in human factors engineering (e.g., the humanmachine\ninterface, the displays to be perceived, and the controls to be actuated). We shall\ndiscuss also the tools and methodologies used by a human factors engineer. The latter portion of the subject will discuss issues of capabilities and limitations of the human operator.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"IE 5301 Human Factors in Engineering and\nDesign","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
