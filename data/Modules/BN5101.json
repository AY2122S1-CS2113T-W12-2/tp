{"moduleCode":"BN5101","title":"Biomedical Engineering Systems","description":"This course will provide a systematic approach to the development of the state-of-art medical devices and systems. Students will study the processes of unmet needs identification, problem statement, technical innovations, IP strategies, clinical trials and regulatory approval. Using some of the major focus of today\u0027s biomedical engineering research systems as examples, such as like medical robotics and diagnostic systems, this module will allow students to build and apply the skills in design and development of novel medical devices and systems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"EA-06-03","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
