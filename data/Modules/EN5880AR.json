{"moduleCode":"EN5880AR","title":"Literature and the Environment","description":"This course examines the shifting perceptions of the natural world found in a variety of English literary works. Through the study of key literary texts, the evolution of ideas about nature will be traced from the 17th century\u0027s age of scientific discovery to the 21st century\u0027s idea of environmental crisis. A key element of the model will be the use of ecocritical ideas and concepts as a way to approach and understand connections between literature and the environment.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate student with the university or with the approval of the department.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
