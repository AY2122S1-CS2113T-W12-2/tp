{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Epistemologists have recently been applying the tools of their trade to issues of practical import. Some examples include the issue of how to define fake news, of who to believe when purported experts disagree, of whether or why it is good to have a diversity of views, of whether stereotyping or profiling is ever epistemically beneficial when making medical diagnoses or designing algorithms, and of how we should balance any potential epistemic benefits against ethical costs in such cases. This module aims to equip students with the epistemological tools required to understand, discuss, and analyse such issues in depth.","title":"Applied Epistemology","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PH3311","semesterData":[]}
