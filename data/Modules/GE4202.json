{"moduleCode":"GE4202","title":"Remaking the Global Economy","description":"This module examines the interrelationships between transnational corporations (TNCs) and regional development in an era of global economic restructuring. The module seeks to achieve a mixed blend of theory and practice of TNCs and regional development.  It provides students with not only description and explanation of TNC operations, but also practical knowledge in analysing the impact of TNCs on regional development. In addition to regular readings, students are expected to conduct specific case studies on the role of TNCs in regional development.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GE, or 28 MCs in SN, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track. \n\n(Global Studies students) Must have read and passed GE1101E and at least one of the following modules: GE2202, GE3201 and GE3238.
