{"moduleCode":"EE4110","title":"RFIC and MMIC Design","description":"Solid-state microwave circuits are usually realised using planar technologies, which integrate some or all components on a substrate.  Moreover, monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) enable commercial application of microwave technology.  This module therefore teaches design methods for microwave integrated circuits. Topics covered:  review of design concepts. MIC Design: fabrication techniques, modeling of active and passive networks, microstrip and coplanar lines. MMIC Design: lump element design, foundry rules, modeling of active and passive networks, design techniques - Layout and DRC Checks.   Selected Hands-on design work on (a) Passive Network - MIC filter and coupler, and (b) Active Network - MMIC oscillator and mixer.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"EE3104C","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
