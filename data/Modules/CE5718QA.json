{"moduleCode":"CE5718QA","title":"Analysis of Floating Infrastructure \u0026 Renewables","description":"Floating structures have wide applications beyond their traditional use in the oil and gas industry. For land-scarce cities such as Singapore, floating infrastructure provide opportunities for creating space for uses such as parks, storage facilities, residential areas, and farms. Floating structures can also be used for harnessing offshore renewables such as wind and solar energy. This module covers the first-principles analysis methods for different types of floating structures used for a variety of purposes including floating infrastructure, floating wind turbines and floating solar farms. Topics include environmental conditions, calculations of loads and load effects, floating stability, dynamic analysis and station-keeping.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"OT5203 Analysis \u0026 Design of Floating Offshore Structures\nOT5203A Analysis of Floating Offshore Structures","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
