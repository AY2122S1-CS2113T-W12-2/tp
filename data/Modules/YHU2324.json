{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course invites students to think more deeply about the nature of health, disease, and medicine and to connect these with issues of global justice. The goal of the course is to familiarize students with the current debates about the just distribution of health and healthcare resources and the ways in which culture, politics, and economics shape the global public health landscape. Students will explore issues related to personal responsibility, public health and social justice and should be able to apply these concepts meaningfully in their own lives at the end of the course.","title":"Global Justice and Bioethics","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,1.5,8],"prerequisite":"YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU2324","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1430","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-LT1","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1430","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-LT1","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":"YCC1113"}
