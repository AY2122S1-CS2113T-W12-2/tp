{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The course discusses the principles of classical mechanics within a rigorous mathematical framework. Topics may include kinematics, conservative forces, central-force motion, small oscillations, rigid bodies, variational problems, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, non-inertial frames, and special relativity. This course is a prerequisite for most of the Major modules in Physics.","title":"Classical Mechanics","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,0,8.5],"prerequisite":"YSC1213 General Physics and YSC1216 Calculus or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC2203","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["YSC1213","YSC1216"]},"fulfillRequirements":["YSC3210","YSC3246","YSC4222","YSC4223"]}
