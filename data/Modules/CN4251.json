{"moduleCode":"CN4251","title":"Troubleshooting with Case Studies for Process Engineers","description":"This module aims to produce chemical engineers who can contribute and increase the effectiveness of problem solving in the Chemical Process Industries. It introduces robust heuristics and a systematic approach to problem\nsolving, which combines critical and creative thinking with technical knowledge. The skill development is delivered through the presentation of various problem-solving\nstrategies and techniques, and by applying them to real case studies from a few diverse process industries.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN2121: Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics\nCN2125: Heat and Mass Transfer\nCN3132: Separation Processes","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E5-03-19","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
