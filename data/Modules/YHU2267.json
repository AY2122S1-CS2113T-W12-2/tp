Through close studies of visual culture and art production from Japan, China, and Korea, it covers broader themes of modernity, transitions from a pre-modern to modern society, the construction of a national identity vis-a-vis the Western world, and the establishment of official art schools and exhibition practice. With the broader social context of Westernization and modernization, we will examine the many artistic movements and subjects of visual representation that flourished during these tumultuous times.
