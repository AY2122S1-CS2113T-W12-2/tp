{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course will examine the drastic transformation and development in Modern East Asia during the late 18th to early 20th centuries. Through close studies of visual culture and art production from Japan, China, and Korea, it covers broader themes of modernity, transitions from a pre-modern to modern society, the construction of a national identity vis-a-vis the Western world, and the establishment of official art schools and exhibition practice. With the broader social context of Westernization and modernization, we will examine the many artistic movements and subjects of visual representation that flourished during these tumultuous times. This module fulfills the Art History track in the Arts & Humanities major.","title":"Modern Art in East Asia","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3.5,6],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU2267","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1430","endTime":"1730","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-CR15","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
