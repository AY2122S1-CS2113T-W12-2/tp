{"moduleCode":"MA3229","title":"Intro. to Geometric Modelling","description":"Geometric modelling combines elementary geometry, analysis and computing for applications in various disciplines in science and technology, such as computer aided design, computer graphics, biomedical modeling and visualization. The course involves modeling, design and analysis of freeform curves and surfaces and covers the basic mathematics and algorithms. Topics covered include Bernstein polynomials, de Casteljau algorithm, Bezier curves, curve splitting, composite Bezier curves, geometric continuity, tensor product Bezier surfaces; Chaikin\u0027s algorithm, uniform Bsplines, refinement equations, uniform B-spline curves and surfaces, uniform B-spline subdivision algorithms; Non-uniform B-splines, recurrence relations, derivatives, discrete B-splines, nonuniformm B-spline curves and surfaces, discrete B-spline algorithm, homogeneous coordinates and projective transformations, non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS), NURBS curves and surfaces. NURBS is the current industry standard in computer aided design and computer graphics.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"(MA1104 or MA2104 or MA1505 or MA1507 or MA1511 or MA2311) and (MA1101R or MA1506 or MA1508 or MA1508E or MA1513)","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
