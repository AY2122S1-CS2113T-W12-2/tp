{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"As industries continually evolve due to technological advancements, digitalization and globalization; students are increasingly required to adapt, unlearn and relearn within complex and ambiguous settings. This module aims to simulate what working in transdisciplinary teams will be like, and to equip students with the necessary skills to deal with real-life challenges through experiential learning. Students from various disciplines will come together to solve an industry/ societal challenge, leveraging on design-driven methods and the collective knowledge/ skillsets of the team. Students are expected to actively participate in contact sessions and commit to project work (including preparatory hours outside of contact sessions).","title":"Transdisciplinary Innovation Project","department":"Industrial Design","faculty":"Design and Environment","workload":[0,0,0,4,8.5],"prerequisite":"3rd and 4th year undergraduate students","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"ID3127","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":12,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
