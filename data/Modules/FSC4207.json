{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"SP4266","description":"This module introduces students to forensic entomology, the study of insects for medicolegal issues, which has been dated back to China in the 13th century. Studying these forensically important insects is useful in estimating post-mortem intervals. Legal implications will be explored using various case studies. A 5-day field course is incorporated and will be conducted by the forensic entomologist expert in Medical Faculty, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Kuala Lumpur. Students will also visit the Entomology Unit and the Forensic Laboratory in KL. Students will observe the progression of decomposition and be exposed to the different families of forensically important flies.","title":"Forensic Entomology","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,1,1,2,4],"prerequisite":"FSC2101 or LSM1306","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"FSC4207","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-02-25","end":"2022-02-25"},"venue":"LT32","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-02-23","end":"2022-02-23"},"venue":"LT32","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-02-24","end":"2022-02-24"},"venue":"LT32","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-02-22","end":"2022-02-22"},"venue":"LT32","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2022-02-21","end":"2022-02-21"},"venue":"LT32","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["FSC2101","LSM1306"]}}
