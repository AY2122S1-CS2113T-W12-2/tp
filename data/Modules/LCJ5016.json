{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The objective of this yearâ€?long course is to develop analytical skills, research skills and communication skills (written and oral) in first year students. In Semester 1, we focus on objective analysis and communication and also introduce students to basic research skills. In Semester 2, we focus on independent research and advocacy.\n\nExercises and assignments will employ realâ€?life tasks, like office\nmemoranda, court pleadings and client meetings, as means for\nstudents to try out their legal skills. However, the primary focus will be on helping students to hone foundational legal skills that are transferable across subjects and contexts.","title":"Legal Analysis, Research & Communication","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","workload":[1,3,0,0,6],"moduleCredit":"8","moduleCode":"LCJ5016","attributes":{"year":true},"aliases":["LC1016","LCJ5015"],"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"22","startTime":"1230","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LAW_SR4-1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"22","startTime":"1230","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LAW_SR4-2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"21","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LAW_SR4-1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"21","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LAW_SR4-1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_D","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["B","Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_D","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"22","startTime":"1230","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LAW_SR4-1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"22","startTime":"1230","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LAW_SR4-2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"21","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LAW_SR4-1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"21","startTime":"1830","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LAW_SR4-1","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["Unknown","B"]}]}
