{"moduleCode":"UWC2101I","title":"Writing \u0026 Critical Thinking: Interpreting Consumerism","description":"This module will develop students\u0027 critical reading and writing abilities through an active, seminar-style engagement with a variety of materials related to the nature and impact of modern consumer culture. We will begin by examining a number of key theoretical positions concerning the relationship between human nature and the need or desire for material things. Once we have interrogated some of these arguments, we will examine the phenomenon of modern advertising and consider the extent to which individual ads shape our buying habits and even our values. The module concludes by investigating the relationship between today\u0027s corporations and youth culture.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
