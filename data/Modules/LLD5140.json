{"moduleCode":"LLD5140","title":"Law of the Sea: Theory and Practice","description":"The Law of the Sea governs the conduct of States in the oceans. Given that the oceans covers five-seventh of the world’s surface, it is a critical component of international law. It is also relevant for Singapore due to its extensive maritime interests. This course will examine the theoretical underpinnings and the practical implementation of Law of the Sea with the aim of examining how it addresses the ever-increasing challenges in the regulation of the oceans. The course will draw on a wide range of case studies from around the world, with a particular emphasis on Asia.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"LL4140V/LL5140V/LL6140V/LLD5140V Law of the Sea;\nLL4140V/LL5140V/LL6140V/LLD5140V Ocean Law \u0026 Policy in Asia; LL4046V/LL5046V/LL6046V Ocean Law \u0026 Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
