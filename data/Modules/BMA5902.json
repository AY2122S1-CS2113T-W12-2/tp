{"moduleCode":"BMA5902","title":"Entrepreneurship Practicum","description":"Riding on the NUS Enterprise’s Lean Launchpad program, this module is an elective to provide MBA students opportunities to participate \u0026 engage in real-world entrepreneurship, and learn how to commercialize an innovative idea. Since there is no better way to learn than through practice, the students will have to get out of the classroom and talk to potential customers, partners and\ncompetitors to experience the uncertainty that comes with commercialising and creating new ventures.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"P2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66}]}]}
