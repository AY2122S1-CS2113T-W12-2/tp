{"moduleCode":"ISD5106","title":"Sustainability Models and Blueprints","description":"The Singapore experience over four decades – in managing resources, waste and infrastructure, balancing environment, economy and community – has been much reported and discussed. It is generally acknowledged that there is much to learn from Singapore’s success and that lessons learnt here might be a development model for parts of Asia. This module covers the many facets of the Singapore experience, probing its success and scalability. Also covered here will be other models, relevant to rural conditions that are prevalent in much of Asia, situations where the challenges of social equity drive the process.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SDE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Design and Environment","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"SDE1-SR5-6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"3","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"ERC-SR10","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"SDE2_ER4-5","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"UT22-07-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1800,"venue":"SDE4-EXR1-2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1800,"venue":"UT22-07-02","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1800,"venue":"SDE2-MEZZ","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"5","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"SDE2_ER4-5","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":900,"endTime":1300,"venue":"UT22-07-02","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1800,"venue":"SDE2_ER4-5","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
