{"moduleCode":"UTW2001E","title":"Ethics in Outer Space","description":"Venturing into space, the most hostile of extreme environments, poses a host of complex and unusual challenges to human well-being.  Through examination of the physiological, psychological and social factors that astronauts must contend with, students will engage with the ethical questions that confront governmental and private agencies when sending men and women into space. Before selecting specific ethical questions to explore in their research papers, students will also examine  the motivations (scientific, commercial, political) behind different kinds of space mission and consider the moral obligations humankind may be under with regard to the exploration and potential exploitation of extraterrestrial environments.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"I\u0026E I","preclusion":"Students who have already read an I\u0026E II module.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16}]}]}
