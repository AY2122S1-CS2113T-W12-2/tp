Through examination of the physiological, psychological and social factors that astronauts must contend with, students will engage with the ethical questions that confront governmental and private agencies when sending men and women into space. Before selecting specific ethical questions to explore in their research papers, students will also examine  the motivations (scientific, commercial, political) behind different kinds of space mission and consider the moral obligations humankind may be under with regard to the exploration and potential exploitation of extraterrestrial environments.","title":"Ethics in Outer Space","department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","workload":[0,4,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"I&E I","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTW2001E","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
