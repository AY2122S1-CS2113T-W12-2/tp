{"moduleCode":"BL5238","title":"Infectious Disease Modelling","description":"Infectious disease modelling has a distinguished history going back to the 1700s and is becoming ever more relevant to human society. This module teaches core skills of infectious disease modelling, focussing on the mathematical analysis of dynamical systems and computer programming of individual-based models in R. The first half of the module will cover classic models, such as Bernoulli’s smallpox vaccination model from the 1700s, Ross’s malaria model from the early 1900s, and Kermack–McKendrick’s susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model. The second half of the course will focus on more-recent case studies of currently relevant diseases.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
