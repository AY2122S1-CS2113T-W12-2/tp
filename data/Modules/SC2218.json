{"moduleCode":"SC2218","title":"Anthropology and the Human Condition","description":"See the world afresh through the lens of anthropology and its distinctive ways of studying, thinking and understanding the social and cultural underpinnings of human behaviour, institutions, and practices. Once described as a science of man, anthropology confronts the facts of human diversity, inviting you to delve deep into questions of what it means to be human. How do language, culture and the\nenvironment shape us? How do we understand people and societies vastly different from our own? Anthropological thinking offers a grounded, human-centred approach to contemporary problems in fields like education, health, media, urban planning, organizations, policy, and businesses.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D2","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"D1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
