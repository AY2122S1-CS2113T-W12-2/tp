{"moduleCode":"YSS3306","title":"Modern History of Economic Globalisation","description":"What has been the course, causes, and consequences of economic globalisation? This module has as its focus the long-run evolution of the global economy, particularly events from 1800. This roughly 200 year period is instructive in that it witnesses the integration of the world’s nations into the first truly global economy, its disintegration in the wake of WWI, the post-WWII reintegration of the global economy, and its potential reversal into the present day. The course will examine variation in institutions, policy, and technology to understand this evolution and its effects on development, inequality, and international relations.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSS1203 Principles of Economics or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
