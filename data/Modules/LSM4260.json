{"moduleCode":"LSM4260","title":"Plankton Ecology","description":"Phytoplankton and zooplankton are a vital part of aquatic\necosystems and form the basis of aquatic food webs.\nUnderstanding the role of plankton in aquatic ecosystems\nwill help in advancing the solutions to problems facing\ntoday’s water resources (harmful algal blooms,\neutrophication and pollution). This module focuses on the\nbiodiversity and ecology of phytoplankton and\nzooplankton, the roles they play in marine and freshwater\necosystems, their potential uses as biofuel and in\naquaculture. The module will consist of lectures, practicals\nand a hands-on application of modelling on phytoplankton\ndatasets.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"LSM2253 OR LSM3254","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 22, 2021, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":60,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S2-0415","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S2-0415","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":50}]}]}
