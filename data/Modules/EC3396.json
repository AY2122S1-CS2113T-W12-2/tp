{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"\"Why is there this thing called â€œgovernmentâ€?? Why do we need to own stuff? Why is theft illegal? Why is\nit occasionally good to breach a contract?â€? These questions touch very distinct areas of the law. But\nthere is one way to go about answering all of them: Economic Analysis! In this class we will show that\neconomic efficiency is what makes a good law and that laws that donâ€™t make sense can be critiqued with\neconomic arguments. Law and economics is a class that expands the scope of economics and limits the\narbitrariness of the law.","title":"Economic Analysis of Law I","department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"EC2101","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EC3396","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS2-0312","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-04-26T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"EC2101"}
