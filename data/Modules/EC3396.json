{"moduleCode":"EC3396","title":"Economic Analysis of Law I","description":"\"Why is there this thing called “government”? Why do we need to own stuff? Why is theft illegal? Why is\nit occasionally good to breach a contract?” These questions touch very distinct areas of the law. But\nthere is one way to go about answering all of them: Economic Analysis! In this class we will show that\neconomic efficiency is what makes a good law and that laws that don’t make sense can be critiqued with\neconomic arguments. Law and economics is a class that expands the scope of economics and limits the\narbitrariness of the law.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"EC2101","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 26, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS2-0312","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
