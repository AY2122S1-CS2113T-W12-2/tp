Can we trust machine learning models?  This module aims to answer this question, by covering the fundamental aspects of reasoning about trust in machine learning, including its robustness to adversarial data and model manipulations, the privacy risks of machine learning algorithms for sensitive data, the transparency measures for machine learning, and fairness in AI. It covers the algorithms that analyze machine learning vulnerabilities; and techniques for building reliable and trustworthy machine learning algorithms.","title":"Topics in Computer Science: Trustworthy Machine Learning","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,0,0,4,4],"prerequisite":"CS3244 Machine Learning","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS6283","attributes":{"lab":true},"semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"CS3244"}
