The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund regulate certain aspects of trade.  There are multilateral instruments which deal with issues such as corruption, ethical business standards, investment protection, competition and the regulation of financial services.  The jurisdictional reach of large powers over international markets also provides means of self-interested regulation.  The international regulation of new technologies such as internet and biotechnology pose novel problems.  This course addresses the issues that arise in this area in the theoretical and political contect of globalization.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent","preclusion":"Students who are taking or have taken LL6022","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
