{"moduleCode":"TS3236","title":"Theatre Ecologies","description":"What can theatre and performance do in the face of climate change, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss? This module explores how a range of playwrights, theatre-makers, and performance artists have responded to this question. Drawing on a wealth of recent eco-conscious scholarship within\ntheatre and performance studies, we consider topics such as eco-theatre, theatre and the anthropocene, theatre and the posthuman, theatre and animals, immersive and site-responsive performance, and ecoscenography. The module also considers how the application of environmental and eco-critical paradigms to theatre may enable a deeper understanding of what theatre is.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"TS1101E or GEM1003 or GEH1058 or GEK1055","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS1-0302","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
