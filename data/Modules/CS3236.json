{"moduleCode":"CS3236","title":"Introduction to Information Theory","description":"This module introduces the basics of modern information theory. It covers how information can be quantified, and what this quantification tells us about how well we can compress and transmit information without error. It discusses basic error correcting techniques, and information-theoretic cryptography. Topics covered\ninclude: mathematical techniques, entropy measures, fundamental limits to data compression and noisy-channel coding, examples of error-correcting codes, examples of information theoretic cryptography (commitments, secure computation, key distribution, randomness extraction).","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"(MA1100 or (CS1231 or its equivalent)) and \n(EE2012/A or MA2216 or ST2131 or ST2334)","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1700,"endTime":1800,"venue":"COM1-0201","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20}]}]}
