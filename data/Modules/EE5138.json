{"moduleCode":"EE5138","title":"Optimization for Electrical Engineering","description":"The module exposes students to a variety of techniques to formulate and solve optimization problems for applications in electrical and computer engineering. The topics include convex sets, convex functions, convex optimization problems (including both linear and nonlinear formulations), duality and KKT optimality conditions, numerical algorithms for both unconstrained and constrained optimization problems, and selected examples from applications in electrical and engineering.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"Mathematical background of an undergraduate course in ECE","preclusion":"EE5138R or EE6138 Optimization for Electrical Engineering (Advanced)","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E1-06-09","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":42}]}]}
