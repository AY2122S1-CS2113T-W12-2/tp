{"moduleCode":"GL3201","title":"Doing Global Visual Culture","description":"What do Instagram and Google Street View have in common with smart bombs and police mugshots? How do memes communicate politics? This module explores how globally shared (or not) understandings of the world today are shaped by images. Together, we’ll approach global visual culture as both active participants and critical scholarly researchers; address methodological issues in creating, consuming, and studying globalization visually; and contend\nwith what it means to produce visual scholarship. Using an experiential approach, you will produce a visual essay on an aspect of globalization. No photography or videography skills required, just access to any kind of camera.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"ARS2 students and above only.
