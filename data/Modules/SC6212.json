{"moduleCode":"SC6212","title":"Global Transformations","description":"This seminar will examine the complexities and the challenges to global social order and peace. With global transformation and the emergence of an interdependent world society, there has been a proliferation of risks. From ecological crises to the intensification of poverty, social inequality and social exclusion to the conflicts and violence on ethnic and religious lines have made the world a risky place. Theories of globalization will be applied to examine the social contexts and consequences of these crises, risks and violence. Globalization will be viewed as a complex process of cultural clashes intersecting with modern economy and polity. Using an inter-disciplinary framework, the seminar will explore the possibilities of minimizing risks and violence in a new global social order.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"SC6211A","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2130,"venue":"AS1-0212","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25}]}]}
