{"moduleCode":"EC3386","title":"Port Economics","description":"The rapid process of globalisation over the last decade with intensive international trade, foreign investment and manufacturing outsourcing and the booming resources sector, has had pervasive effects on the way ports are built and operated, from providing simple ship shelter and warehouse services to much more complex, multimodal terminal services, from monopoly to competition, and from state/government-owned to local private corporations. Port Economics explores fundamental issues related to port operation and management from the economic perspective, including but not limited to port planning and development, competition, tariff design, performance monitoring, policies and regulations.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":4,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1100,"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1100,"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"W01","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS2-0311","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"W02","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS2-0311","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
