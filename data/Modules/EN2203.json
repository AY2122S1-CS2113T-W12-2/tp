By the end of the module, the student must (i) understand how mise-en-scene, editing, lighting, cinematography, and sound function to create meaning; and (ii) be able to write clearly and knowledgeably about how larger cultural, aesthetic, social, and philosophical contexts shape cinematic production and reception.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"EN2113","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
