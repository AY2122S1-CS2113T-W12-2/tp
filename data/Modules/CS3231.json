{"moduleCode":"CS3231","title":"Theory of Computation","description":"This module examines fundamental aspects of computation that every computer scientist should know. What is a finite automaton and how does it relate to regular expressions (and searching a database)? What is a context-free language and how does it relate to parsing languages? What is the P vs. NP problem and why does it matter? How do we decide if a problem is easy or hard? This module introduces techniques for precisely formulating problems and studying their properties using a variety of commonly used reasoning techniques (e.g., model equivalence, non-determinism, digitalisation, simulation and reduction).","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"(CS1231 or equivalent) and (CS2040 or its equivalent)","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 27, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
