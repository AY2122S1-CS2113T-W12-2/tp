{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module examines fundamental aspects of computation that every computer scientist should know. What is a finite automaton and how does it relate to regular expressions (and searching a database)? What is a context-free language and how does it relate to parsing languages? What is the P vs. NP problem and why does it matter? How do we decide if a problem is easy or hard? This module introduces techniques for precisely formulating problems and studying their properties using a variety of commonly used reasoning techniques (e.g., model equivalence, non-determinism, digitalisation, simulation and reduction).","title":"Theory of Computation","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"(CS1231 or equivalent) and (CS2040 or its equivalent)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS3231","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-11-27T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"and":["CS1231","CS2040"]}}
