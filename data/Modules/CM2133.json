{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"CM1131 Physical Chemistry 1, CM2101 Physical Chemistry 2","description":"This module covers foundational physical chemistry concepts. Students will learn how the wavefunction description of matter leads to energy quantization. This concept is applied to spectroscopic analysis whereby the basic theory, instrumentation and applications of UV-visible, FTIR, Raman and NMR spectroscopy will be described. The laws of thermodynamics that characterize and govern physical chemical systems will also be taught and applied to phase and chemical equilibria. In chemical kinetics, the rate laws, reaction mechanisms and simple rate theories will be discussed","title":"Foundations of Physical Chemistry","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[4,1,0,2,3],"prerequisite":"CM1102 Chemistry â€“ The Central Science","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM2133","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT31","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT26","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-0224","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-0224","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-0224","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-06T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":"CM1102"}
