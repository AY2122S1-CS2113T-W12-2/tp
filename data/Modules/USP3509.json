{"moduleCode":"USP3509","title":"Law and Violence","description":"The concept and practices of law are inseparable from the concepts and practices of force and/or violence. In this module we will investigate three questions. First, is there a difference between legitimate and illegitimate violence, and so, what is the difference and how is it explained? Secondly, what is the, and why is there an, internal relationship between law and violence? Finally, why do we punish? We will read texts from various thinkers, including Walter Benjamin, Bentham, Robert Cover, Derrida, Foucault, Kant, Locke, Nietzsche, Rousseau, A. John Simmons, Robert Paul Wolff and others.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.
