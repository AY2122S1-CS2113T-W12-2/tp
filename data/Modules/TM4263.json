How the data between the manufacturing systems are transferred, their standard protocols are also covered. In addition the following topics are covered: Concepts of discrete-event modelling and simulation, definitions, types, essential elements in modelling, design and implementation of  manufacturing simulation models, petri-nets, model verification and validation, input information collection and analysis, interpretation of outputs, use of random inputs and variance reduction techniques, protocol standards, communication topology, MAP/TOP.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SCALE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"ME3162 , ME3162E, TME2162, TM2162, ME2162E","preclusion":"TME4263","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":3,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"EA-06-07","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":14},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2030,"venue":"EA-06-07","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":14},{"classNo":"1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"EA-06-07","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":14},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2030,"venue":"EA-06-07","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":14}]}]}
