{"moduleCode":"MDG5245","title":"Neuronal Signaling and  mechanisms of effective Learning","description":"In this module, we take multidisciplinary approach to understand the cellular and molecular  basis of  neuronal signalling and  the mechanisms of memory and effective learning:\n\nWe will discuss:\n1.Basic functions of neurons, memberane potential, action potential and channel  properties and functions.\n2. Pre and Post synaptic  mechanisms of neurotransmission.\n3. Taxonomy of memory and functions of different brain areas  for the formation , storage and retrieval of memory.\n4. Synaptic Plasticity  and its mechanisms  for  short and long-term memory  formation.\n5. Molecular mechanisms of memory.\n6. Disorders of brain function and memory.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"NUS Medicine Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","preclusion":"GSN6501","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
