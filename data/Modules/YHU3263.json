{"moduleCode":"YHU3263","title":"The Bandung Conference of 1955","description":"Against the backdrop of the Cold War, the Bandung Conference of 1955 stands as a symbolic event in the history of decolonisation of Asia and Africa. We examine ‘Bandung’ as a nodal point from which a variety of postwar narratives emerged, including freedom and independence, non-alignment, Third World internationalism, connecting even the US civil rights movement with Bandung. A diverse range of materials will be explored, including popular writing, film, photographs, newsreels, newspapers, journals, official documents, as well as a field trip to the conference museum in Bandung to consider the role of public history.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
