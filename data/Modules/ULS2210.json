{"moduleCode":"ULS2210","title":"Invertebrate Innovations","description":"Invertebrates are the animals lacking backbones that comprise \u003e90% of the animal kingdom. Despite this, they remain superficially known to most people. This module gives much-needed attention to this megadiverse group, focusing on the varied biological innovations in aspects of their anatomy, physiology, and behaviour, which enable them to survive in particular habitats. We examine how such innovations in invertebrates have inspired man-made designs, materials and technologies across disciplines, which lead to human innovations that benefit society; and how the study of invertebrates more broadly contributes understanding of the natural world that also indirectly benefits society.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1200,"venue":"UT-AUD3","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30}]}]}
