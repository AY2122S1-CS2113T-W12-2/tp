{"moduleCode":"GSN6502","title":"Developmental Neurobiology: from genes to neuronal circuits","description":"During development of the nervous system, billions of neurons with trillions of synaptic connections are assembled in complex neuronal circuits, which underlie\nevery aspect of brain function, from simple motor tasks to complex emotions. In this module we will describe our current understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that shape neuronal circuits during development in health and disease states, with emphasis on the following topics: \n- Induction and patterning of the nervous system.\n - Birth and migration of neurons.\n- Axon guidance to their target fields.\n- Synapse formation.\n- Mechanisms of regeneration and repair.\n- Neurodevelopment disorders.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Integrative Science and Engineering Program","faculty":"NUS Graduate School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
