{"moduleCode":"YHU3337","title":"Money and the Rise of the State","description":"In Western and Southern Eurasia, the rise of the state is linked to the development of money and credit. In the ancient Near East, all-purpose money facilitated economic growth, efficient taxation, and engendered the development of civil law.\nThe invention of coinage and currencies in the Greek World accelerated this process, and laid the foundations of a financial system that spanned Europe, Western Asia, and India, and which survived in the Islamic World.\nThe course is intended to show students that economic features typically associated with modernity have deep roots in antiquity, and continue to shape the world today.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"All Year 1 and 2 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
