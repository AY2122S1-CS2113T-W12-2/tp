{"moduleCode":"CAS5881","title":"Silk Routes in Asia: Where the Global Meets the Local","description":"Although the term “Silk Road” was only coined in the\nlate nineteenth century, the many land and maritime\ntrade routes linking different parts of Asia have\nfacilitated the movement of people, as well as the\nspread of ideas, commodities, and everyday practice\nfrom pre?modern times to the present. Treating the\nsilk routes as networks of exchange as well as sites of\ninteractions where local dynamics meet global\nprocesses, this module not only canvasses the\nintellectual, social, artistic, and cultural histories of\nAsia, but also examines the theories and\nmethodologies of writing connected and/or\ncomparative Asian histories.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
