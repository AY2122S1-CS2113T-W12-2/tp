{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"What we call â€œHinduismâ€? is a modern, originally Western, concept that aggregates a multiplicity of traditions as a single religious tradition. However, many Indians took on this identity and shaped it as their own, and as they did, the Bhagavad-GÄ«tÄ? played an important religious and political role in this emerging self-conceptionâ€”as it still does today. This course examines the way in which the GÄ«tÄ? is implicated in the history of Hinduism as a religion, through a range of texts (letters, comics, treatises, translations) focusing on the early 20th century.","title":"Hinduism, Nationalism, and the Bhagavad Gita in the 20th  Century","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
