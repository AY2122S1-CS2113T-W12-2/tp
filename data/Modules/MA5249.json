{"moduleCode":"MA5249","title":"Stochastic Processes and Algorithms","description":"This module discusses theories for Markov chain, and how to implement them in various stochastic algorithms. We investigate Markov chains in both discrete and continuous-time settings. We discuss how to implement one step analysis and derive equations for important quantities such as hitting times. We also discuss how to derive martingales to control the process. Finally, we investigate how does a\nMarkov chain converges to its invariant measure using coupling techniques. These theoretical tools will be applied to design and analyze various stochastic algorithms.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA2216 or Departmental Approval","preclusion":"EE5137, BDC6306, MA4251","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 29, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}]}]}
