{"moduleCode":"PF1103","title":"Digital Construction","description":"This module is designed to provide an overview of concepts and applications of digital construction. Computational thinking concepts form the theoretical basis of this module and will be incorporated to teach how computation can be used to accomplish goals including the measurement and taking-off of quantities. It will provide students with a foundation of programming skills with applications in digital construction. Students will acquire skills in the visualisation and interpretation of construction drawings and measurement including 2D/3D CAD and 3D BIM models. Major topics include introduction to building elements, computational thinking basics and applications in digital construction such as BIM.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Built Environment","faculty":"Design and Environment","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 27, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"5","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"SDE2-ES1","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"SDE2-ES1","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"SDE2-ES1","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"SDE1-CL2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"UT-AUD1","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":180},{"classNo":"6","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"SDE2-ES1","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"SDE1-CL2","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30}]}]}
