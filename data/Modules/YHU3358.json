{"moduleCode":"YHU3358","title":"Crime and Punishment","description":"One of the central functions of the state is to protect us from each other and mediate our disputes; likewise, one of the central tasks of moral philosophy is to prohibit wrongdoing and specify appropriate responses to harm. While there are enormous personal, social, and economic costs associated with crime, many approaches to dealing with crime are irrational, wasteful, and harmful to victims, society, and perpetrators alike. This course provides a culturally comparative and multidisciplinary exploration of foundational questions related to the questions of crime and punishment, moral responsibility and social justice. It also contains a mandatory service/experiential learning component.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 and YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 (Required).
