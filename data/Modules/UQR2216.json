{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"A tools-and-soft-skills module introducing Python machine learning, with hands-on modelling via pre-programmed templates. Students will be gently ushered into the artificial intelligence landscape, so that they might henceforth—as an insider—keep abreast with the ecosystem’s constant reshaping.\n\nBroad appreciation of introduced models from a decision-maker’s perspective will be emphasized, without deep dive into program coding. Students will learn to communicate responsively and congenially with senior management and technical colleagues alike.\n\nWe will equip students to thoughtfully follow the accelerating analytics transformations within modern organizations. Students may then deservedly take a seat with enlightened movers and shakers digitizing future workplaces.","title":"Thoughtful Learning with Machines","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","workload":[0,4,0,4,2],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UQR2216","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
