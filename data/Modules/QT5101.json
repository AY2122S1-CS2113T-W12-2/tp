{"moduleCode":"QT5101","title":"Quantum measurements and statistics","description":"This module deals with quantum measurement theory and the interpretation of the observed statistics. It covers advanced mathematical formalism of quantum measurement; Bell’s inequalities; and the quantum-to- classical transition (notably decoherence). Emphasis is put on providing both the understanding of the concepts and the ability of using the mathematical tools.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Center for Quantum Technologies","faculty":"NUS Graduate School","prerequisite":"PC2130 Quantum mechanics 1\nPC3130 Quantum mechanics 2","preclusion":"There are no precluded modules.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
