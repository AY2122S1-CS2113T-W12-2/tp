{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"YHU2297 Classical Chinese Philosophy or \nYSS3241 Chinese Political Philosophy: Confucianism and Its Rivals","description":"This course will provide a survey of the different conceptions of freedom in Classical Chinese Philosophy. It examines different classical philosophers in China through the notion of freedom, and also, reflects on common cultural tropes about Chinese intellectual history. We will think through the nature of the individual self, the existence of human will, and the relation of that self to society via varying Chinese intellectual traditions, from Confucianism and Daoism to Legalism among others. By the courseâ€™s end, students are expected to have acquired a critical awareness of the diverse perspectives of Chinese philosophers on metaphysical and political freedom.","title":"Conceptions of Freedom in Classical Chinese Philosophy","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YHU2327","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1730","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-KChanrai","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1730","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-KChanrai","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":"YCC1113"}
