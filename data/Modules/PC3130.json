{"moduleCode":"PC3130","title":"Quantum Mechanics II","description":"This module continues from PC2130 and completes the basic formation of the student in quantum mechanics. Description of composite systems: tensor product, two-particle entanglement; systems of N identical particles. Perturbation theory: time-independent, both non-degenerate and degenerate; example: Zeeman effect. Time-dependent: Fermi golden rule; example: atom in a classical e-m field. Discussion of stimulated and spontaneous emission.\nOther approximation schemes: the variational principle; the WKB approximation and the “classical” region, tunneling and the connecting formula; the adiabatic approximation. Scattering: partial wave analysis and the Born approximation.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC2130 or PC2130B, and PC2134 or equivalent","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Dec 2, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120}]}]}
