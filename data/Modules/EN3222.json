{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module focuses on the emergence of the British novel as it develops from the early fiction of the late seventeenth century to the Regency novels of Jane Austen. We will read this famously amorphous genre through a variety historical and theoretical lenses, ranging from the rise of empiricism to the reconfiguration of gender roles to the eighteenth-century appetite for news and facts. Finally, we will examine the novelâ€™s experiments with form and its characteristic features in order to understand how these narratives helped to consolidate new notions of the â€œmodernâ€? individual.","title":"The Eighteenth Century","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"prerequisite":"(i) EN1101E AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","corequisite":"So long as students have fulfilled EN1101E/GEK1000, they may take this EN level-3000 module in the same semester as they are taking one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"EN3222","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["EN1101E",{"or":["EN2201","EN2202","EN2203","EN2204","EN2205","EN2207","EN2275","EN2276","EN2277"]}]}}
