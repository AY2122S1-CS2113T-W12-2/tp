{"moduleCode":"IE2100","title":"Probability Models With Applications","description":"The module builds upon the foundation in ST2131 and stresses on applications of stochastic modeling. Topics include: Review of exponential distribution; Conditional probability and conditional expectation; discrete time Markov chains; Poisson process; Basic queuing models and continuous time Markov chains and Renewal Theory. Students will eventually be conversant with the properties of these models and appreciate their roles in engineering applications.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"ST2334\nor EE2012 \nor CE2407\nor BN2102","preclusion":"DBA3711","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 27, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1000,"endTime":1100,"venue":"EA-06-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1000,"venue":"EA-06-02","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":35},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":70}]}]}
