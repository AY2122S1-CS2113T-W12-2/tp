{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"GE2230","description":"The extraction, production, distribution and use of energy sources has significant environmental, social, political and economic impacts. Impacts are multiâ€?scalar, ranging from global climate change to socioâ€?cultural disruption at local, national and regional scales. This module exposes students to these impacts and related energy geopolitics with detailed case studies. The module also gives students a comprehensive background of the development and use of promising future post-carbon alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, and biofuels. It discusses how to build the energy-efficient architecture of a low carbon economy and develop sustainable energy system design for the future.","title":"Energy Futures: Environment and Sustainability","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,2,0,2,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GE3254","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"DO2","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"DO1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"DO3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"DO4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
