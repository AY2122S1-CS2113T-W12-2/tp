{"moduleCode":"PS4225","title":"Contemporary Issues in Chinese Politics","description":"Massive social and economic change in recent decades has induced new forms of politics in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Many urban workers lost the\nsecurity of state jobs, while millions of farmers seized opportunities to move to cities for work. Social unrest increased in rural, residential, and industrial settings.\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which rose to power with peasant support, now finds support among entrepreneurs. This seminar examines a selection of\nimportant political issues in the PRC today. Potential areas of emphasis include contentious politics, nationalism and ethnic tension, CCP reform, rural development, and corruption.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
