{"moduleCode":"LL6061V","title":"Inquiry","description":"In this module, students will be encouraged to reflect upon what is really involved in pursuing a life of intellectual work. To this end, students will undertake a philosophical exploration of research and scholarship as it is routinely conducted across the experimental and social sciences, the humanities, literature and philosophy. Drawing upon insights achieved by historians, scientists, legal thinkers, sociologists, philosophers and literary writers into their respective crafts, students will explore not only the practical techniques recommended by these practitioners, but more significantly, the habits and virtues that have been found to be most conducive to successful practice.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent","preclusion":"Students who are taking or have taken LL6061.","corequisite":"For Non-Law Students: Open to students from University Scholars Programme who have read 80MCs or more.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
