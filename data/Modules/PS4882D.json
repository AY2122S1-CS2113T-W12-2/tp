{"moduleCode":"PS4882D","title":"Topics in IR: Politics of Global Migration","description":"This seminar examines the causes and consequences of\n\ntransnational migration, a complex and little\n\nunderstood aspect of globalisation. How have\n\ngovernments and international organizations\n\nresponded to mass population movements? How has\n\ntransnational migration been treated as a political,\n\neconomic, security, and human rights issue? What are\n\nthe gender aspects of migration? We will explore these\n\ntopics through historical and contemporary\n\nperspectives on migrants and refugees. We will\n\nconsider a wide range of sending and receiving\n\ncountries, focusing on states and movements in\n\nSoutheast Asia.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
