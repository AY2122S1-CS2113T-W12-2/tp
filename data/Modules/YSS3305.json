{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course examines the comparative political economy of capitalist societies, broadly defined as the relationship between the market and the state, and the ways in which the triangular relationship between the state, labor and business differs from one capitalist country to another. The course will survey cases from North America, Western Europe and East Asia, as well as a number of important themes such as poverty and welfare, racial and gender disparities, neoliberalism, financialization and globalization. There will be heavy emphasis upon the transformation in the political-economic landscape facing capitalist societies in the period since the end of the 1970s.","title":"The Political Economy of Capitalism","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3.5,6],"prerequisite":"YCC1121 Comparative Social Inquiry and YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3305","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["YCC1121","YCC2121"]}}
