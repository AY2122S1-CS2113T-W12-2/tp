{"moduleCode":"CE6077A","title":"Numerical methods in Civil Engineering","description":"This course introduces the basic principles to the numerical methods used for analysis of mechanics and environmental flow problems. Fundamental concepts in finite difference method, and the associated convergence and stability issues will be covered.\n\nThe concepts of grids, issues with them and possible solution methods will be discussed. The module will enable the students to acquire the basic numerical analysis knowledge and computational skills through mini-projects and homework assignments.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CE2407 or equivalent","preclusion":"CE5311, CE5377/6077, CE6003","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E4-04-02","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
