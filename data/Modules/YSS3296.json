{"moduleCode":"YSS3296","title":"International Trade, Resource Use and the Environment","description":"This short course investigates the links between international trade, natural resource use and the environment.  The lectures will address five key questions.  One, to what extent are natural resources traded, and by whom?  Two, what are the impacts of international trade on a country with weak or poor management of its natural resources? Three, is there evidence that international trade leads to severe overuse of natural resources? Four, is there evidence international trade is a common driver of resource overuse worldwide? Five, does access to international markets make governance of natural resource industries easier or harder for governments?","moduleCredit":2.5,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSS2203 Intermediate Microeconomics or with the permission of the instructor.","corequisite":"YSS2203 Intermediate Microeconomics or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
