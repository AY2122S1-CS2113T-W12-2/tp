{"moduleCode":"ESP2111","title":"Sensor System Electronics","description":"This module introduces students to the fundamental electronic principles of sensor systems for a variety of different disciplines. Particular emphasis will be given to circuits that are used in research and development, such as sensor amplifiers, filters, and data-acquisition. The module has both analogue and digital circuit principles, and involves project activities that involve hands-on construction of sensors, their circuits and translating their signals into digital data on to a computer.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Engineering Science Programme","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"ESP1104A Sensor System Electronics\nESP1104B Sensor System Electronics","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":45}]}]}
