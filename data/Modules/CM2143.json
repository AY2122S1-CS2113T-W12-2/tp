{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"Cohort AY2020/2021 and earlier","description":"This is a first course in analytical chemistry and shall introduce to students a toolkit for performing a chemical analysis in the 21st century. This toolkit consists of sampling methods; sample treatment and preparation; statistics; data treatment and several ubiquitously-used analytical techniques. These include principles and applications of separation science with a focus on gas and liquid chromatography, electrochemistry (voltammetry, coloumetry, potentiometry), gravimetry, titrimetry and elemental analysis. Lectures will be complemented by practical sessions to give the students a good grounding in the basics of chemical analysis.","title":"Basic Toolkit of Analytical Chemistry","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","workload":[1.5,0,1.5,0,7],"prerequisite":"CM1102 Chemistry â€“ The Central Science","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CM2143","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT33","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT20","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1800","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-01GEN","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1800","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0402","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1800","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S5-01GEN","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1800","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S8-0402","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":"CM1102"}
