{"moduleCode":"CM2143","title":"Basic Toolkit of Analytical Chemistry","description":"This is a first course in analytical chemistry and shall introduce to students a toolkit for performing a chemical analysis in the 21st century. This toolkit consists of sampling methods; sample treatment and preparation; statistics; data treatment and several ubiquitously-used analytical techniques. These include principles and applications of separation science with a focus on gas and liquid chromatography, electrochemistry (voltammetry, coloumetry, potentiometry), gravimetry, titrimetry and elemental analysis. Lectures will be complemented by practical sessions to give the students a good grounding in the basics of chemical analysis.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM1102 Chemistry – The Central Science","preclusion":"Cohort AY2020/2021 and earlier","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT33","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT20","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1200,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S5-01GEN","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S8-0402","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1200,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S5-01GEN","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S8-0402","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":25}]}]}
