{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The course provides an overview of the petrochemical industry, with a focus on the Singapore industry. The processes that are covered include crude oil composition, refining, steam reforming, and steam cracking, along with applications of syngas (ammonia, methanol and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis). Important heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic processes, and derivatives from C1 to C6 base chemicals are also covered. To provide an in-depth understanding, fundamentals of the chemical synthesis, processes, catalysis, kinetics, thermodynamics and reactor design will be highlighted.","title":"Petrochemicals and Processing Technology","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2.5,0.5,0,1,6],"prerequisite":"CN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN2121: Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CN4211R","attributes":{"lab":true},"semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["CN2116","CN2121"]}}
