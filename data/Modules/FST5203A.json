{"moduleCode":"FST5203A","title":"Advanced Food Microbiological Analysis and Food Safety","description":"This module provides an overview of food microbiology and food safety related topics following an easy-to-understand flow of WHO ARE THEY (foodborne pathogens, opportunistic pathogens, and microbial indicators); HOW TO FIND THEM (microbial analysis); WHERE ARE THEY (source tracking of foodborne pathogens); WHAT DO THEY DO (challenge study to determine the fate of foodborne pathogens and predictive microbiology); HOW TO CONTROL THEM (mitigation and prevention). Fundamental knowledge will be systematically reviewed and advanced concepts will be introduced by interactive activities over research and real-life oriented questions.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Food Science and Technology","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"FST3101 or LSM3232 or by permission","preclusion":"FST5203","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2000,"venue":"LT31","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90},{"classNo":"1","startTime":2000,"endTime":2100,"venue":"LT31","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":90}]}]}
