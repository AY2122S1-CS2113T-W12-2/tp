{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"FST5203","description":"This module provides an overview of food microbiology and food safety related topics following an easy-to-understand flow of WHO ARE THEY (foodborne pathogens, opportunistic pathogens, and microbial indicators); HOW TO FIND THEM (microbial analysis); WHERE ARE THEY (source tracking of foodborne pathogens); WHAT DO THEY DO (challenge study to determine the fate of foodborne pathogens and predictive microbiology); HOW TO CONTROL THEM (mitigation and prevention). Fundamental knowledge will be systematically reviewed and advanced concepts will be introduced by interactive activities over research and real-life oriented questions.","title":"Advanced Food Microbiological Analysis and Food Safety","department":"Food Science and Technology","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"FST3101 or LSM3232 or by permission","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"FST5203A","attributes":{"mpes2":true,"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"2000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT31","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"2000","endTime":"2100","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT31","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":90,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-05T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["FST3101","LSM3232"]}}
