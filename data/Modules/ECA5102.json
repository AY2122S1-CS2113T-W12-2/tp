{"moduleCode":"ECA5102","title":"Macroeconomics","description":"This subject covers topics in modern Macroeconomic Theory and Policy at the advanced level. The emphasis will be laid on recent advances in the theories about long-term growth and short-term business cycle, and in the related empirical and policy debates. The growth theory includes neoclassical growth models (particularly the Ramsey and overlapping-generations models), and various endogenous growth models with knowledge spillovers, human capital and R\u0026D investment. We also consider income distribution, convergence, income ranking, and population ageing in the growth models. The business cycle theory includes the real-business cycle model and various New Keynesian models. The policy issues include national debt, social security, and monetary policies. It helps students understand the frontier debates in macroeconomics.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","preclusion":"EC5152, EC5102A","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 29, 2021, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"2","startTime":1830,"endTime":2130,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":85},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT8","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":49}]}]}
