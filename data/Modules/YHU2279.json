Topics include the relation between theoretical discourse and one’s lived life; philosophy and living well;philosophy as a way of life and “religion”; protreptic arguments for pursuing philosophy; therapeutic arguments; spiritual exercises; and the extent to which this conception of philosophy remains viable today.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
