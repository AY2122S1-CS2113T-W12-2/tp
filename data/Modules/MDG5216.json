{"moduleCode":"MDG5216","title":"Applied Ethics in Public Health and Healthcare Policy","description":"This module aims to equip students to identify and critically evaluate  ethical considerations in policies, systems and interventions intended to protect and promote the health of populations. Students will be introduced to ethical theories and frameworks used in public health, and asked to consider the role of culture, values and context in applying these in practice. Seminars will revolve around topics in disease prevention and control, resource allocation in healthcare, and global health. Case studies in, e.g. vaccination ethics, use of technology in healthcare, tobacco control, etc, will illustrate the application of key principles. Students will be assessed via presentations and written submissions, and participation in class discussions and an online forum.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"NUS Medicine Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
