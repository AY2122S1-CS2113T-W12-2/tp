{"moduleCode":"YHU4229","title":"Plato on Knowing and Being Good","description":"Knowing makes you a good person, and seeking to know is morally\nimproving. Plato apparently commits himself to these crazy claims.\nWe will investigate why. What is knowledge such that seeking it is\ngood for us? What effect does inquiry have on character? How\nmust we conceive of the good if knowing is not to be merely\ninstrumentally good? Does it matter, morally, which conception of\nknowledge we have? To address this latter question, we will\nconsider the much different epistemology of the Indian Buddhists, who also consider knowledge to be indispensible to the ultimate good.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Two Philosophy modules other than YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 and YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
