{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Plants and people have interacted for thousands of years. Plants have served as sources of food, shelter, medicine, and fibre, while humans have changed the abundance, distribution, disturbance and genetic makeup of plants.  We will draw upon both basic biology and applied historical, anthropological, and artistic perspectives to explore these relationships. The course will be a mix of lectures, discussions and local field trips.","title":"Plants and People","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[3,0,3,1,5.5],"moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YID2214","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0830","endTime":"1030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ERC-ALR","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0830","endTime":"1030","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"ERC-ALR","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
