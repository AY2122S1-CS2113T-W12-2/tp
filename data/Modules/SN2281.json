{"moduleCode":"SN2281","title":"Nations at Play: History of Sport in South Asia","description":"This course looks broadly at the evolution of sport and play, especially those that enjoy mass popularity in South Asia, and what it says about the region’s society, economy and politics. Cricket, the emblematic sport of South Asia, is of course given particular attention but hockey, football and wrestling are also looked at in some detail. The course examines the story of sport in South Asia through its evolution from an elite, kingly pastime and its encounter in successive stages with colonialism, nationalism, the state and globalization.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
