These changes in the areas of jurisdiction, content regulation, moral values, security, etc. will be explored, as well as their global implications and regulatory constraints of the Internet. This module explores new media governance\nprocesses that involve collective action by governments, international organisations, NGOs, the private sector and civil society to establish agreements about standards, policies, rules, enforcement mechanisms and dispute resolution procedures. It will emphasise challenges it presents to stakeholders and how sometimes trade-offs are necessary.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in NM or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non?language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\n(For SOC students) Completed 80 MCs and obtain a minimum CAP of 3.20.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in NM, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track. \n\n(For SOC students) Completed 80 MCs and obtain a minimum CAP of 3.20.","preclusion":"NM3202, NM2202","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":45}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
