{"moduleCode":"BMC5029","title":"Value chains, logistics and operations","description":"This module introduces students to the strategic operating issues (decisions) involved in managing value chains and logistics systems in any organization. A value chain transforms resources into goods, service, or both. Effective and efficient management of the value chain is a major competitive advantage. Such advantages, however, can only be realized to the fullest when the whole logistics system is managed holistically. Hence, the capability to manage operations to achieve system objectives is a key ingredient for success. An understanding of it is essential for all managers. Principles for transforming organizations to operational excellence will be emphasized.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"S1","startTime":830,"endTime":1830,"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":60},{"classNo":"S1","startTime":830,"endTime":1830,"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":60},{"classNo":"S1","startTime":830,"endTime":1830,"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":60},{"classNo":"S1","startTime":830,"endTime":1830,"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":60}]}]}
