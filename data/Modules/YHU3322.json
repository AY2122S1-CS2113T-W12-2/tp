{"moduleCode":"YHU3322","title":"Crazy Rich Europeans: Wealth \u0026 Power in Modern History","description":"Why do some families get rich while others get impoverished? Is enrichment purely the result of actions by manager geniuses like Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs? Crazy Rich Europeans explores the emergence of global capitalism and the business dynasties it produced. We will examine how commodities such as cotton, chocolate, and gold underpinned the rise of the global “top one percent.” This course examines the history of business life in light of modern European and global history: the role of colonialism and “war capitalism” emerge as key themes.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","preclusion":"YHU4239 The Age of Capital: Business, Elites and Power in 19th and 20th Century Europe","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
