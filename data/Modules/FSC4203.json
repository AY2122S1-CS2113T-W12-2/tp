This multi-disciplinary module aims to support medical and legal investigation into the cause of death, poisoning and adverse responses to substances. Drawing from the foundational principles in toxicokinetics, students will be able to (1) study the physicochemical properties of substances and their effect(s) on the host and (2) consider the toxicological outcomes of exposure due to the unique handling of substances by organ systems. The lectures will conclude with real-life applications led by practitioners.","title":"Forensic Toxicology and Poisons","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","workload":[2,1,1,3,3],"prerequisite":"FSC2101 or LSM1306","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"FSC4203","attributes":{"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["FSC2101","LSM1306"]}}
