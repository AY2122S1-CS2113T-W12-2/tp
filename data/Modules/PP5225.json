{"moduleCode":"PP5225","title":"India\u0027s Foreign Policy and National Security","description":"India is a rising power. Its foreign policy and national security choices will be consequential for South Asia, for neighbouring regions such as Southeast Asia, for Asia as a whole, and increasingly for the world. India has always played a fairly large role diplomatically, beyond its neighbourhood. It is poised to extend its military influence as well. The course attempts to provide students with an overview of the problems that India confronts and how it typically goes about dealing with those problems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","preclusion":"PP5242N","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
