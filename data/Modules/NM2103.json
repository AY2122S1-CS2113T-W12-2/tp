It covers fundamental concepts in research design, instrumentation, data collection, and data analysis. This module also introduces basic concepts of statistics such as descriptive statistics, sampling distribution, hypothesis testing. A set of computer lab assignments will give students extensive opportunities to become familiar with the relevant computer software package and experience at computing the various statistics reviewed in the class.","title":"Quantitative Research Methods","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"NM2103","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"W2","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":23,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"W3","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":23,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"W4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":23,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"W5","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":23,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":23,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"W6","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":23,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":138,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"W3","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W4","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W5","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT10","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W2","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"W6","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS6-0215B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":20,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-04-29T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}]}
