In this module, students will critically examine how citizens and their leaders use communicative resources to deal with issues pertaining to sustainability, processes of inclusion and exclusion, and public participation in various contexts, among others. What rhetorical strategies do they mobilize to encourage dialogue needed to create agreeable solutions to the burning issues of the day? What strategies hamper such a dialogue to take place? By pursuing these questions, the students will develop a critical disposition towards the role of civic discourse in shaping public issues.","title":"Citizen Speak: Persuasion and Polarization in Society","department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","workload":[0,4,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying English Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic Purposes modules.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"RVX1000","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RVR-SRM04","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RVR-SRM04","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RVR-SRM04","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RVR-SRM04","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":16,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
