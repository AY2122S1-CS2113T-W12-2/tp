{"moduleCode":"BN1101","title":"Engineering Principles and Practice I","description":"This module is the first of a set of two modules: Engineering Principle and Practice I and II (EPP I and EPP II). EPP modules aim to introduce first year students to the biomedical engineer’s way of thinking and addressing problems. A real-life medical technology will be used to demonstrate the fundamental knowledge and skills that a biomedical engineer is expected to possess. In EPP I, students will be exposed to key engineering problems such as how to analyse a complex medical \ntechnology, how to design and fabricate a prototype and how to predict failure.","moduleCredit":6.0,"department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
