{"moduleCode":"SWK5074","title":"Pathways to Desistance - Offender Rehabilitation Theories","description":"In-prison programming, counselling and casework services are an integral part of offender rehabilitation and re-entry into the community. There is relatively a lacuna in the scholarship to offer a theoretical understanding to design programmes, counselling and casework services that are appropriate for offender rehabilitation. Modern approaches include RiskNeed-Responsivity (RNR) principles and to a great extent, Good Lives Model (GLM). However, in recent years, there is a burgeoning desistance research to advocate for a more holistic method to support the offenders in their reintegration.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"Social Work","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"SWK5070 Crime and Criminality: A Multidisciplinary Perspective, and\nSWK5071 Criminal Justice in Context: A Critical Introduction","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
