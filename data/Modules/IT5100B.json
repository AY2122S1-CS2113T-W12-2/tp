{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The global availability of data has reached a level where aggregating data into generic, general-purpose â€œstoresâ€? is no longer feasible. Having data collections statically available for querying by interested parties on demand is increasingly becoming the way of the past. Instead, a new paradigm, called Data Streaming, has emerged recently. In this paradigm, data is bundled into high-throughput â€œstreams'' that are sharded efficiently across a large number of network nodes. Consumers, sometimes counted in hundreds of thousands, or millions, â€œsubscribeâ€? to data subsets and are notified when new data becomes available, being under the obligation to process it immediately, or lose it. Consequently, data storage is no longer centralized, but rather distributed into many smaller-sized abstract collections. \n\nThis new approach to â€œBig Dataâ€? requires a new set of tools, platforms, and solution patterns. In this course we propose to explore several facets of this new paradigm: \nâ€¢ The Stream paradigm introduced in Java 8. \nâ€¢ Platforms that implement Data Streaming, such as Kafka, and the Java bindings in the library KafkaConnect. \nâ€¢ Computing paradigms for stream processing, such as Reactive Programming, and the library RxJava. \nâ€¢ High-performance stream computing platforms, such as Flink. \n\nThe course will be using Java as the main vehicle for introducing concepts and showcasing examples.","title":"High-Throughput Stream Program","department":"Information Systems and Analytics","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,0,0,2,1],"moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"IT5100B","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1100","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
