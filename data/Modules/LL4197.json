{"moduleCode":"LL4197","title":"Comparative State and Religion in Southeast Asia","description":"How do Southeast Asian constitutions accommodate religion? Is secularism necessary for democracy? Do public religions undermine religious freedom? These are some of the questions we will be engaging with in this course.\n\nThere are two segments to the course. In the first segment, we will examine general theories of statereligion relations, including liberal assumptions of the dominant theory of the separation of church and state (the “disestablishment theory”), the rise and fall of the secularization thesis, and alternative theories.\n\nDuring the second segment, we will examine statereligion relations through topical issues in selected countries in Southeast Asia, including how legal systems in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia accommodate Syariah Courts, and how separationist claims based on religious difference and identities are advanced in the Philippines and Thailand.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"For law students: NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent\n\nFor non?law students: 3rd \u0026 4th Year students from Arts \u0026 Social Sciences Faculty who has completed PS1101E Introduction to Politics","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
