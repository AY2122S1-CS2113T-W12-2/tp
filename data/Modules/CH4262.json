Treating Singapore-Malaysia\nas a nexus to consider its literary relations in\nthe long 20th century with other localities (e.g.,\nmainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong), this course\nintroduces the critical concept of “place” to account for\nthe shifting attributes and implications of the cultural\nlinkages affecting our perspectives on literary heritage.\nThrough literary texts that address questions of\nsojourn, mobility and migration, it highlights the\nimportance of historicisation when analysing literary\ntransregionalism and shows how geographical distance\ndoes not necessarily co-relate with the strength of\nconnections.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including minimum 28 MCs in CH or CL, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS3-0303","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":30}]}]}
