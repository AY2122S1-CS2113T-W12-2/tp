{"moduleCode":"UWC2101U","title":"Writing \u0026 Critical Thinking: Technologies of Home","description":"Domestic life is routinely held up for admiration as pure or natural.  But how many of us experience family time/space in that way?  Challenging the truism that domesticity offers a refuge from the modern world, this module recognises that technology makes it possible for modern people to be, and feel, at home.  Some relevant technologies involve engines or electronics.  But others organise ideas about gender, room, place and belonging.  By enhancing awareness of domesticity’s “constructed nature,” this module deepens understanding of home sweet home.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":12}]}]}
