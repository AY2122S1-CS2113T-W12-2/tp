{"moduleCode":"BMA5237A","title":"Topics in Managing Global Value Chains and Networks","description":"This course examines the dynamics involved in an MNE’s quest for global value chain optimization and risk management, with a focus on the Asia Pacific region. We will go beyond fundamental supply chain management and explore how other so-called “secondary” drivers influence the core “primary” drivers of international value chains.\n\nThe class will explore how information technologies are impacting IVCs, and how real-time data management, social media and other “disruptive” technologies are redefining IVCs. Students will also study economic trends and regulatory environments involving global trade and tax regime management.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
