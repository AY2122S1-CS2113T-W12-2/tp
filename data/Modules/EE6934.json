{"moduleCode":"EE6934","title":"Deep Learning (Advanced)","description":"Deep learning refers to machine learning methods based\non deep neural networks to learn data representation and\nperform learning tasks. This course covers advanced\ntopics on deep learning. Students taking this course will\nlearn theories, recent models and algorithms. The course\nstarts with machine learning basics and classical neural\nnetwork models, followed by optimization techniques for\ndeep convolutional neural networks, and advanced topics\nincluding recurrent neural networks, deep reinforcement\nlearning, deep generative models and their applications to\ncomputer vision and speech recognition. The students are\nexpected to have good knowledge on calculus, linear\nalgebra, probability, statistics as a prerequisite.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"EE5907 Pattern Recognition. Requires good proficiency in a scientific programming language, such as Python (e.g. CS1010 Programming Methodology; IT1007 Introduction to Programming with Python \u0026 C or equivalent).
