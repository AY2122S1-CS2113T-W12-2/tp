{"moduleCode":"GE3224","title":"Cultural Landscapes","description":"This module examines the contribution of cultural geography to an understanding of interrelations of landscape, space and culture. After charting the development of the concept of \u0027landscape\u0027, the module explores cultural landscapes in a variety of historical and geographical settings. Cultural Landscapes works through four key themes: imaginative geographies of exploration and representation; landscape and national identity; moral geographies of environmental conduct and belonging; and issues of cultural deterritorialisation associated with processes of globalisation. The module will be of interest to students across the university seeking to develop critical perspectives on cultural landscape formations at a variety of scales.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
