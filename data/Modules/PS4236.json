{"moduleCode":"PS4236","title":"Environmental Political Theory","description":"In this module, we will discover how environmental\nproblems have exceeded their boundary as an “issue\narea” and have altered contemporary political\ntheorizing. This includes questions related to the roles\nof the state, the borders of the moral community, and\nmatters of justice. We will trace the transformation of\nliberal, republican, conservative, socialist, and feminist\npolitical thought in the wake of environmental politics.\nFinally, we will ask whether there is such a thing as a\ndistinctly “green” political theory.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track, and PS3274.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
