{"moduleCode":"PH4203","title":"Issues in Moral Philosophy","description":"This module examines different issues in meta-ethics or normative ethics. It asks questions such as: Can ought be derived from is? Are there natural laws? Is morality about an agent’s character or actions? Are actions morally justified by consequences or compliance with moral laws or principles? It may also examine and assess different schools of moral philosophy, such as utilitarianism, Kantian ethics or virtue ethics, or a current debate among moral philosophers, for example, the nature and role of intuition, or emotions, in acting morally.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80MCs, including 28 MCs in PH or 28 MCs in NM, or 28MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS3-0302","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25}]}]}
