{"moduleCode":"PC2421","title":"Physics of Everyday Phenomena","description":"The satisfaction of understanding how rainbows are formed, how ice skaters spin, or why ocean tides roll in and out — phenomena that we have know — is one of the best motivators available for building scientific literacy. This module aims to make the physics of the world around us accessible to non-science majors. The coverage will be broad, and include Newtonian mechanics, fluid and heat, electricity and magnetism, waves and optics, and modern physics, with emphasis on relevance to everyday phenomena. The use of mathematics will be limited in this module and subordinated to the physical concepts being addressed.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC1101 Frontiers of Physics","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
