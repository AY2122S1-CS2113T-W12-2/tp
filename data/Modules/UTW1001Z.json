{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"Students who have already read a IEM1201%, UTW1001% and ES1501% module.","description":"Colour has fascinated humans for millennia, yet it is poorly understood. What is the symbolic meaning of colours across cultures? How do colours impact our psychological well-being and our consumer choices? From the earth pigments of the prehistoric painters, to the synthetic colours of the Impressionists, colour technology has developed to meet new communication and expression needs and in doing so, a whole repertoire of meanings has evolved. In this module, students will explore scholarly and popular texts from a range of disciplines including visual arts, fashion, psychology, marketing and anthropology to investigate the theory, meaning and practices of colour.","title":"Colour: Theory, meaning and practice","department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","workload":[0,4,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying English Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic Purposes modules.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTW1001Z","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"TC-SR6","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR6","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR6","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"TC-SR6","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR6","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"RC4-SR6","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
