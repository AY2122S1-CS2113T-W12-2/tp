{"moduleCode":"SC5103","title":"Qualitative Data Analysis","description":"Increasingly, more qualitative research work is being under-taken in its own right rather than as preliminary research for subsequent quantitative surveys. This explains the broadening of the range of qualitative research techniques. In addition to dealing with the traditional fieldwork and participant observation methods, the module will examine a number of qualitative approaches. These include techniques of analyzing data generated by laypersons (as in life-documents: diaries, journals, travelogues) communications materials, material artifacts, and visual information. This course is open to postgraduate students with an interest in qualitative research methods.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2130,"venue":"AS4-0604","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":20}]}]}
