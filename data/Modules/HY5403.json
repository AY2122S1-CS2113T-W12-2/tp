{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The notion of Southeast Asia continues to be a site of contestation. In this module, students will be encouraged to imaginatively wade into an ongoing\nconversation as the latest in a long line of interpreters – mythic, historical and contemporary – of Southeast Asian pasts. Students will encounter a wide range of texts and discover how differing contexts, worldviews, theories, methods and source materials have been creatively and imaginatively used to both question and enrich understandings of Southeast Asian pasts. Each iteration of this module will focus on a specific region in Southeast Asia, depending on the expertise of the instructor.","title":"Interpreters of Southeast Asian Pasts","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"HY5403","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS1-0303","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
