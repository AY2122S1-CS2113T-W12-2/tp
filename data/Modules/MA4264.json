{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"EC3312.","description":"Game theory provides a mathematical tool for multi-person decision making. The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to game theory, studying basic concepts, models and solutions of games and their applications.\n\n\n\nMajor topics: Games of normal form and extensive form; Applications in Economics; Relations between game theory and decision making. Games of complete information: Static games with finite or infinite strategy spaces, Nash equilibrium of pure and mixed strategy; Dynamic games, backward induction solutions, information sets, subgame-perfect equilibrium, finitely and infinitely repeated games. Games of incomplete information: Bayesian equilibrium; First price sealed auction, second price sealed auction, and other auctions; Dynamic Bayesian games; Perfect Bayesian equilibrium; Signaling games. Cooperative games: Bargaining theory; Cores of n-person cooperative games; The Shapley value and its applications in voting, cost sharing, etc.","title":"Game Theory","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"(MA3236 or MA3252 or DSA3102 or DSC3214 or DSN3701) and (MA2216 or ST2131 or ST2334)","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MA4264","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT29","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":140,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0405","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1700","endTime":"1800","weeks":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S17-0405","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1000","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT29","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":140,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-04T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":150}],"prereqTree":{"and":[{"or":["MA3236","MA3252","DSA3102","DSC3214","DSN3701"]},{"or":["MA2216","ST2131","ST2334"]}]}}
