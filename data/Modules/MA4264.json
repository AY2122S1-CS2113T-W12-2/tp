{"moduleCode":"MA4264","title":"Game Theory","description":"Game theory provides a mathematical tool for multi-person decision making. The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to game theory, studying basic concepts, models and solutions of games and their applications.\n\n\n\nMajor topics: Games of normal form and extensive form; Applications in Economics; Relations between game theory and decision making. Games of complete information: Static games with finite or infinite strategy spaces, Nash equilibrium of pure and mixed strategy; Dynamic games, backward induction solutions, information sets, subgame-perfect equilibrium, finitely and infinitely repeated games. Games of incomplete information: Bayesian equilibrium; First price sealed auction, second price sealed auction, and other auctions; Dynamic Bayesian games; Perfect Bayesian equilibrium; Signaling games. Cooperative games: Bargaining theory; Cores of n-person cooperative games; The Shapley value and its applications in voting, cost sharing, etc.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"(MA3236 or MA3252 or DSA3102 or DSC3214 or DSN3701) and (MA2216 or ST2131 or ST2334)","preclusion":"EC3312.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 4, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"LT29","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":140},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1800,"endTime":1900,"venue":"S17-0405","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1700,"endTime":1800,"venue":"S17-0405","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"LT29","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":140}]}]}
