{"moduleCode":"UTS2709","title":"Energy and Singapore: Dynamics, Dilemmas and Decisions","description":"Energy in Singapore depends mainly on imported fossil fuels/petroleum/natural gas. Obviously, in the quest for alternatives, future energy demand and mix, some challenges/dilemmas arise naturally in Singapore context: would nuclear energy deployment be feasible? Is wind energy a viable option? would a complete switch to solar, biofuels, and waste-to-energy technologies be possible? This module offers a systems and system dynamics approach to deal with such issues and the corresponding dynamics, dilemmas and decisions that arise while addressing them. Students gain insights into the political, socio-economic and environmental aspects of these challenges through relevant case studies/models.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","preclusion":"UTC2718 or UTS27%","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
