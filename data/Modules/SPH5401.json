{"moduleCode":"SPH5401","title":"Health Economics and Financing","description":"This module addresses the economic and financing\naspects of the production, distribution, and organisation of\nhealth care services and delivery. This includes the\nstructure of health care delivery and insurance markets,\ndemand for and supply of health services, pricing of\nservices, cost of care, financing mechanisms, and their\nimpact on the relevant markets. A special emphasis will be\ngiven to market failures and the role of government in the\nmarket for health services. Through textbook readings and\ndiscussions of seminal articles and more recent empirical\napplications in health economics, students will learn the\neconomic way of thinking. They will be given the\nopportunity to showcase these skills through a series of\nresearch papers written throughout the semester that will\nculminate with a final manuscript that provides an in-depth\nanalysis of a critical health issue.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","preclusion":"CO5204 Health Economics and Financing","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"MD1-08-03E","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
