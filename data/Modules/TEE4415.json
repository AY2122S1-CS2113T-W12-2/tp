{"moduleCode":"TEE4415","title":"Integrated Digital Design","description":"This module introduces the students to the design of integrated circuits. It covers basic concepts including integrated circuits fabrication technology, CMOS and nMOS design, inverter design, aspect ratios of pull-up and pull-down transistors, switching characteristics of CMOS and nMOS inverters, latch-up, stick diagram, design rules, mask layout, sub-systems design, ASIC challenges and issues, ASIC design flow, Verilog hardware design language basics, and logic synthesis. Each student will do a design exercise using the EDA tools.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SCALE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"TEE2020 or TEE2026","preclusion":"EE4415E","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2030,"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":15},{"classNo":"1","startTime":2030,"endTime":2130,"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":15}]}]}
