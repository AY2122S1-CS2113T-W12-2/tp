{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This is a new module which aims to highlight the relevance and importance of physics in many aspects of technology. It aims to serve as the overview module to expose the students to a few key technological development when Physics plays a vital role. This module will be conducted by our own lecturers. The selected topics will be current and directly relevant to the potential career options that the MSc students will be considering. Discussion of each topic shall cover the basic physics principles leading to the state of the art development in the technology. The duration on each topic can last from 2 weeks to 3 weeks. Examples of the topics include energy and batteries, solar energy systems, quantum technologies, computer modelling in Physics, sensor devices, microelectronics, advanced functional materials, communication systems, biophysical instruments, etc.","title":"Physics and Technology","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,0,1,3,3],"prerequisite":"Departmental approval","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC5101","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Hybrid_B","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":49,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Hybrid_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":49,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
