{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"- Application Development Project\nThis is a pre-internship project where the students will work in a team to apply the project management, analysis, design, business communications and programming skills learnt earlier in the course. Based on a User Requirement Statement given to the students, they will go through a complete software development life cycle to develop and deliver the required system. The students will capture requirements through user interviews, produce a feasible design of the system, code, test and implement the solution in a distributed platform. This project provides a simulation of the real-life IT working environment, and tests their strengths in working closely as a project team.","title":"AD Project","department":"Institute of Systems Science","faculty":"Institute of Systems Science","workload":[0,0,0,15,0],"moduleCredit":"6","moduleCode":"SA4106","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2021-07-15","end":"2021-08-12"},"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2021-07-14","end":"2021-08-11"},"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2021-07-16","end":"2021-08-06","weeks":[1,2,4]},"venue":"","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2021-07-13","end":"2021-08-10"},"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2021-07-12","end":"2021-08-02"},"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2021-12-15","end":"2022-01-05"},"venue":"Interaction","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2021-12-16","end":"2022-01-06"},"venue":"Interaction","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2021-12-13","end":"2022-01-03"},"venue":"Interaction","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2021-12-14","end":"2022-01-04"},"venue":"Interaction","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2021-12-17","end":"2021-12-31"},"venue":"Interaction","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}]}
