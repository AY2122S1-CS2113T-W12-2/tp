{"moduleCode":"SA4106","title":"AD Project","description":"- Application Development Project\nThis is a pre-internship project where the students will work in a team to apply the project management, analysis, design, business communications and programming skills learnt earlier in the course. Based on a User Requirement Statement given to the students, they will go through a complete software development life cycle to develop and deliver the required system. The students will capture requirements through user interviews, produce a feasible design of the system, code, test and implement the solution in a distributed platform. This project provides a simulation of the real-life IT working environment, and tests their strengths in working closely as a project team.","moduleCredit":6.0,"department":"Institute of Systems Science","faculty":"Institute of Systems Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}]},{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"Interaction","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"Interaction","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"Interaction","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"Interaction","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1700,"venue":"Interaction","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":150}]}]}
