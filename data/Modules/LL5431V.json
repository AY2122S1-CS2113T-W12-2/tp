{"moduleCode":"LL5431V","title":"Choice of Law: Practice and Theories","description":"This course explores the tensions in choice-of-law decision-making in selected areas or sub-fields spanning human rights violations, foreign sovereign debts, environmental liability, currency swaps, international trusts, multiple-listed corporations, and time permitting, economic torts and internet defamation and/or employment and human capital development. In each specific area, it asks whether a choice-of-law theory can shed light on the tensions which the choice-of-law rule seeks to balance and whether another can lead to development of a better or more coherent rule.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"Not open to anyone who has done a substantially similar course elsewhere\nLL4431/LL5431/LL6431 Choice of Law: Practice and Theories","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
