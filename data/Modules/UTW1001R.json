Students will be introduced to ways of critically analyzing speeches as they interrogate the power and limitations of oratory in influencing the public mind.  Students will consider the following questions:  What elements in the speeches enable speakers to ‘adjust ideas to people and people to ideas’?  How do speeches shape and get shaped by their contexts?  How are ideas expressed in the speeches transformed to create impact on the public mind?","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying\nEnglish Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic\nPurposes modules.","preclusion":"IEM1201%,\nUTW1001%,\nES1501%","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
