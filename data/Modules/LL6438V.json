Traditionally thought of and taught as distinct areas of law, the overlap between IP rights and recourse to arbitration for the protection of those rights has grown significantly in recent years. This pioneering course is not currently offered in any other leading law school in the world. It is designed for students with little to\nno knowledge of IP law. It is also designed for students with an interest in arbitration, regardless of the level of their preexisting knowledge of arbitration.","title":"Intellectual Property Arbitration","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"LL6438V","aliases":["LL5438V","LL4438V"],"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Hybrid_D","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":1,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
