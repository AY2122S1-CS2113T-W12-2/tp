{"moduleCode":"EE5131","title":"Wireless Communications","description":"This course covers various basic topics in wireless communications for voice, data, and multimedia. It begins with an overview of current wireless systems and\nstandards, followed by a characterization of the wireless channel, including path loss, shadowing, and the flat vs. frequency-selective properties of multipath fading. It then examines the fundamental capacity limits of wireless channels and the characteristics of the capacity-achieving transmission strategies. This part is followed by practical digital modulation techniques and their performance\nunder wireless channel impairments, including diversity techniques to compensate for flat-fading, multicarrier modulation to combat frequency-selective\nfading, and an introduction to multi-antenna communications. The course concludes with a discussion of various practical multiple access schemes in wireless cellular systems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","preclusion":"EE6131 Wireless Communications (Advanced)","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDate":"Nov 23, 2021, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
