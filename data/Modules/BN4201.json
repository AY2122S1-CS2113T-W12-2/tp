{"moduleCode":"BN4201","title":"Tissue Biomechanics","description":"The module aims to provide an understanding of the relationship between structure and function in tissue biomechanics; introduce quantitative and qualitative assessment of hard and soft tissues in normal and pathological states; inculcate critical and constructive thinking regarding the recent research literature on tissue biomechanics and explore the potential clinical applications. The major topics include mechanical properties of bones, muscles, cartilage, ligaments/tendons, ocular tissues and cardiovascular tissues. Some examples of clinical applications include but are not limited to: tissue growth \u0026 remodelling, tendinitis, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, aneurysms, glaucoma, myopia, corneal disorders.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"BN2204 Fundamentals of Biomechanics","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
