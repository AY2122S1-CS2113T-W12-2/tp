{"moduleCode":"YHU2309","title":"Medieval Romance: Magic and the Supernatural","description":"This course will explore the rich world of medieval romance through the strange and often beguiling encounters with the supernatural that pervade these texts. Considering shape-shifters, marvellous objects, and experiences of the miraculous or uncanny, we will investigate how romances fashion exotic, escapist worlds that at the same time reflect contemporary values and anxieties. We will ponder what magic reveals about human motivations, especially in situations of moral ambiguity. We will pay special attention to the historical and intellectual contexts in which medieval magic was understood, and to its intersections with other spheres of knowledge such as science and theology.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2 or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
