{"moduleCode":"PH3213","title":"Knowledge, Modernity and Global Change","description":"This module focuses on the ways in which modern science and technology impact on the forms-of-life which cultures and societies have built up for their collective self-understanding and biological survival. Issues in epistemology and how changes in the concept of \"reason\" have contributed to the project of modernity will be explored. The role of technology in its simultaneous creation and destruction of social-material wealth will also be considered. This discussion will be tied to an examination of certain key issues in environmental ethics, social theory, and cultural studies.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
