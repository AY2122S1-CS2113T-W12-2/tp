{"moduleCode":"TCN4203","title":"Polymer Engineering","description":"The course introduces students to the principles of producing a polymer product starting from polymer synthesis to the final engineering design and production. It starts with an introduction to polymer chemistry of various synthesis methods and strategies. This is followed by the analysis and characterization of polymers using the physics of polymers. Finally, techniques for producing or synthesizing polymers will be learnt. The various processing methods such as extrusion, njection modelling, blow molding and film blowing for polymers so produced are discussed. Detailed mathematical analyses of some process operations based on momentum, heat and mass transfer approaches are carried out.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"SCALE Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","preclusion":"CN4203E","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
