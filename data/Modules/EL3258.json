{"moduleCode":"EL3258","title":"The Sociolinguistics of Humour: Jokes and Comedies","description":"This course is about understanding language through the vehicle of humour. It is often the case that people assume the meanings of jokes, cartoons, and comedies based on their knowledge. This course will introduce students to understanding the various types of humour through sociolinguistics and cognitive science approaches.
