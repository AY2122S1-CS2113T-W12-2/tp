{"moduleCode":"UTC2712","title":"Hard to secure easy to waste - Singapore’s food story","description":"A growing population, changing dietary habits and climate change are contributing to the challenge of securing food for Singapore. Singapore imports over 90% of its food supply and uses under 1% of its land area for agriculture.\nIn 2015, Singapore was ranked the second most food secure country in the world. On the other hand, Singapore’s food wastage has increased by 50% since 2005 and 1 in 10 people in Singapore is food insecure. This module takes a systems thinking and systems dynamics perspective to analyse and understand this apparent paradox between food security and food waste in\nSingapore.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","preclusion":"UTS2704 or UTC27%","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
