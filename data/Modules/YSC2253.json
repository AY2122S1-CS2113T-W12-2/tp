{"moduleCode":"YSC2253","title":"Principles of Environmental Science","description":"This module explores how the Earth functions as a complex and inter-connected system throughout the lithosphere (land), hydrosphere (water) and atmosphere (air). We will consider the interaction of physical, chemical and biological processes and highlight the ways in which human activity impacts the resilience of Earth systems. Classroom learning will be supplemented with field excursions to understand first-hand how environments are structured and their response to human disturbance.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YID1201 Introduction to Environmental Studies or with the permission of the instructor.","preclusion":"YID2209 Biogeophysical Systems","corequisite":"YID1201 Introduction to Environmental Studies or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
