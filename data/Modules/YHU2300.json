{"moduleCode":"YHU2300","title":"Exhibitions and the Sites of Display","description":"This course will introduce students to the many sites and ways in which artworks and objects have been exhibited within different historical and cultural contexts. Starting with the Renaissance cabinets of curiosities and concluding with the establishment of the present-day global museum, we will consider how curatorial practices and audience reception (and agency) have changed from the early modern to the postmodern, and familiarise ourselves with some of the debates surrounding the establishment of secular sites of art display, including the role of the exhibition as a nation-building enterprise. Museum visits will be scheduled during the semester.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"All Year 1 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
