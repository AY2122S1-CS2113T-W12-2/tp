{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"Students admitted into the Pharm Sci major and Pharm Sci minor programmes.","description":"This 6-week module is delivered by blended learning and integrates basic, clinical and systems sciences to enable students to recognize, assess, prevent and treat diseases affecting the human hepatic and renal systems. The basic sciences include physicochemical and pharmacological properties of the drugs, metabolism and excretion of drugs, principles of toxicodynamics and toxicokinetics, and pathological changes that affect ADME processes. Applied therapeutics and therapeutic drug monitoring will form the clinical bases for effective and safe care plans. Systematic review and meta-analysis provide essential evidence for positive predictive value and negative predictive value of screening tests for liver and kidney diseases.","title":"Hepatic and Renal Systems: Science & Therapeutics","department":"Pharmacy","faculty":"Science","workload":[6,3,3,2,16],"prerequisite":"PR1152 Pharmacy Foundations: Science & Therapeutics I\nPR1153 Pharmacy Foundations: Science & Therapeutics II\nPR2156 Integumentary & Ocular Systems: Science & Therapeutics","moduleCredit":"6","moduleCode":"PR2155","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"MD1-05-01A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":80,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT33","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":160,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT33","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":160,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT33","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":160,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"C4-02-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1800","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"MD1-05-01A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":80,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"C4-02-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-05-05T05:00:00.000Z","examDuration":150}],"prereqTree":{"or":["PR1152","PR1153","PR2156"]}}
