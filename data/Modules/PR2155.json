{"moduleCode":"PR2155","title":"Hepatic and Renal Systems: Science \u0026 Therapeutics","description":"This 6-week module is delivered by blended learning and integrates basic, clinical and systems sciences to enable students to recognize, assess, prevent and treat diseases affecting the human hepatic and renal systems. The basic sciences include physicochemical and pharmacological properties of the drugs, metabolism and excretion of drugs, principles of toxicodynamics and toxicokinetics, and pathological changes that affect ADME processes. Applied therapeutics and therapeutic drug monitoring will form the clinical bases for effective and safe care plans. Systematic review and meta-analysis provide essential evidence for positive predictive value and negative predictive value of screening tests for liver and kidney diseases.","moduleCredit":6.0,"department":"Pharmacy","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PR1152 Pharmacy Foundations: Science \u0026 Therapeutics I\nPR1153 Pharmacy Foundations: Science \u0026 Therapeutics II\nPR2156 Integumentary \u0026 Ocular Systems: Science \u0026 Therapeutics","preclusion":"Students admitted into the Pharm Sci major and Pharm Sci minor programmes.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 1:00:00 PM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1800,"venue":"MD1-05-01A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":80},{"classNo":"2","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"4","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"S16-0431","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT33","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":160},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT33","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":160},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"LT33","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":160},{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"C4-02-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1400,"endTime":1800,"venue":"MD1-05-01A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Laboratory","size":80},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1700,"venue":"C4-02-01","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40}]}]}
