{"moduleCode":"CN4122","title":"Process Synthesis and Simulation","description":"This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical\nprocesses.","moduleCredit":3.0,"department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"CN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN2121: Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics\nCN3124: Particle Technology\nCN3132: Separation Processes\nor\nCN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN2121: Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics\nCN2122/CN2122A: Fluid Mechanics\nCN3132: Separation Processes","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45},{"classNo":"5","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45},{"classNo":"7","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1100,"endTime":1300,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":280},{"classNo":"3","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_A","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":45}]},{"semester":2,"examDate":"Apr 27, 2022, 9:00:00 AM","examDuration":120,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E2-0306PC3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E2-0306PC3","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":30},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1100,"endTime":1300,"venue":"EA-06-02","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60}]}]}
