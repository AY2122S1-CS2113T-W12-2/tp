{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module will introduce students to basic ecological principles which underlie the practice of ecological landscape design. It will provide students with a fundamental understanding of the composition, structure and dynamics of ecological systems such as forests, lakes, streams, wetlands and cities. It will also provide students with a working knowledge of several ecological concepts such as stability, complexity, diversity, equilibrium, conservation, restoration, sustainability and resilience. A mixture of lectures, reading materials, field trips and discussions will assist students in providing insights on how to fill the knowledge gaps between the science of ecology and the practice of landscape architecture.","title":"LAD3006 Basics of Ecology","department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","workload":[3,0,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"LAD3006","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1700","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
