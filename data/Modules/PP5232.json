This module builds on the gateway module (PP5451 Foundations of Sustainable Development and Environmental Economics) and introduces advanced level economic analyses of natural resource management. The analyses involve critical reviews of concepts and methods \nin both microeconomics and macroeconomics leading to the formulation of resource management policies some of which deviate from acknowledged norms.
