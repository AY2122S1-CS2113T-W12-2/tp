{"moduleCode":"ME5361","title":"Advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics","description":"This is an advanced module on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) at the graduate level. The module introduces some newly-developed numerical techniques for simulation of fluid flows as well as convective heat transfer problems. Major topics covered in this module include: high-order numerical approaches for solving boundary-layer and Navier-Stokes equations; boundary integral method for linear systems; upwind and Godunov-type schemes for compressible flow simulation; lattice Boltzmann method for incompressible flow simulation. There is a compulsory Term Paper project for this module. The module is recommended for research students and engineers who intend to do research project in the CFD area.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDate":"May 5, 2022, 5:00:00 PM","examDuration":150,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E3-06-07","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40}]}]}
