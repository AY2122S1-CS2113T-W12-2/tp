As active participants\nor unwilling captives, women from a variety of backgrounds helped to forge\nthese new societies. They disguised themselves as sailors and soldiers,\nresisted enslavement, and fostered new spiritual movements. Some\ntransgressed customary gender roles and challenged sexual norms, while\nothers benefited from emerging systems of inequality.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"All Year 1 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
