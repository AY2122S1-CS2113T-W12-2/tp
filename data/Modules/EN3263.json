{"moduleCode":"EN3263","title":"Singapore Literature in Context","description":"Using selected Singapore texts from a variety of different genres, this module aims to enable students to explore the historical roots and contemporary relevance of literary production in Singapore. Beginning with colonial writing, the module moves through considerations of national and postcolonial literatures to contemporary concerns.
