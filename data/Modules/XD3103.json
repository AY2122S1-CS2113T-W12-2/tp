An understanding of geology is\n\nimportant to many disciplines, providing information\n\nabout the physical and chemical processes that\n\ndetermine the distribution of resources, location of\n\nhazards, operation of surface processes and the\n\ninteraction between engineering structures and earth\n\nsurface materials. The four components of the module\n\nbegin with consideration of the earth’s structure and\n\nthe role of plate tectonics, before considering the\n\nnature of earth surface materials and the functioning of\n\nearth surface systems.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":100},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E4","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
