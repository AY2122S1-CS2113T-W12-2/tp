{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"With the end of Moore's Law, we are witnessing a paradigm shift in computing platforms towards the inclusion of specialized hardware accelerators. In this module, we will explore the designs of system software on these emerging computing hardware platforms. We will first take a broad overview of existing and upcoming specialized hardware devices, including GPU, TPU, FPGA, SmartNICs, reconfigurable network switches, and other specialized ASICs. We will then discuss various topics in systems design for these new hardware platforms, e.g., OS constructs, abstractions, programming models, resource sharing and multiplexing, scheduling, co-designing with applications and algorithms, and joint processing with CPU.","title":"Topics in Computer Science: Systems Design for Next Gen Hardware","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"CS2100 Computer Organization and CS2106 Introduction to Operating Systems","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS6280","attributes":{"lab":true},"semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["CS2100","CS2106"]}}
