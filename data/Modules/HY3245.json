{"moduleCode":"HY3245","title":"Engendering History/Historicising Gender","description":"Gender is a primary way of signifying relationships of power. This module adopts a historical perspective on the ways in which gender has provided for articulating and naturalising differences.\n\n\n\nAfter an introduction to the development of gender as an analytical concept in history, the module proceeds to provide a grounded exploration of the imbrication of gender and modernity. With colonialism as the starting point, the issues of gendered discourses and practices as well as the materiality of the body and of the global structures in which they are enmeshed will be studied.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"LT9","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":40}]}]}
