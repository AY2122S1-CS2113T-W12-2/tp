{"moduleCode":"BL5217","title":"Population Genomics and Phylogenomics","description":"The module will examine how genome-wide datasets can be applied to questions relating to the evolutionary history of animal and plant lineages. Some of the major topics discussed will be \n(1) genome-wide datasets used to entangle rapid radiations, \n(2) genome-wide SNPs deployed to discover patterns of gene flow between neighbouring lineages, \n(3) introgression and admixture across hybrid zones, and many more.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1000,"endTime":1200,"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":50}]}]}
