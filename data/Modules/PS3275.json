{"moduleCode":"PS3275","title":"Regimes in Transition","description":"Few things are more dramatic than the collapse of a political system, whether through violent conflict or peaceful negotiations. Explaining why regimes break down and why new ones emerge are among the most important questions in political science. This module looks at the conditions under which regimes unravel, focusing on the breakdown of democratic institutions, the rise of populism, and conversely, transitions away from various types of authoritarian regime, using case studies from Southeast Asia. PS2234, while not a pre-requisite, is strongly recommended.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"PS1101E","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"D1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS3-0212","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"E2","startTime":1200,"endTime":1400,"venue":"AS3-0307","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25},{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"AS8-0401","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":75},{"classNo":"E1","startTime":1600,"endTime":1800,"venue":"AS1-0304","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":25}]}]}
