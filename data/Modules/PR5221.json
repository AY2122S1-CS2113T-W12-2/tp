{"moduleCode":"PR5221","title":"Molecular Targets in Drug Discovery","description":"The aim of this module is to equip students with a better understanding of the molecular basis of modern drug discovery using selected examples of classes of drugs, with a special focus on drug target selection and validation. In this module, we will also discuss selected signaling cascades and pharmacological intervention in these processes. The use of animal and cellular models to validate molecular targets will also be covered. Students will gain an enhanced understanding of the drug discovery process which will complement their technical expertise in the field.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Pharmacy","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Relevant degree or special permission","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
