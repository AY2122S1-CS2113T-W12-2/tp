{"moduleCode":"EE6832","title":"Selected Topics in EM Metamaterial and Multiple-Antenna","description":"The objective of this module is to provide students with the theory, concepts, and applications of electromagnetic (EM) metamaterials and multi-antenna/array technology. The fundamentals of EM metamaterials are covered in the first part. In particular, the latest progress in the metamaterials-based antennas is described. Starting with fundamentals of conventional antenna arrays, the second part describes the latest developments and techniques in antenna arrays and multi-antenna systems. The concepts and their applications of phased arrays, beaforming array, smart antenna technology, MIMO antenna technique, etc. in 5G and SatCom are introduced. Their unique design challenges of the antennas and arrays are discussed.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","prerequisite":"EE5308 or EE5308R","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":1800,"endTime":2100,"venue":"E1-06-08","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
