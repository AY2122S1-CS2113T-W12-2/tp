{"moduleCode":"YHU3350","title":"Slurs, Insults \u0026 Hate Speech: Pragmatics of Pejoratives","description":"Some words are insulting and considered unacceptable to utter, and others words are derogatory yet acceptable at least in some contexts. Some words even seem to be able to cause material harm to individuals or groups. How can we account for these phenomena and what should we, as language-users do about it? This course will focus on the pragmatics of pejoratives, the philosophical study of disparaging speech. We will focus especially on disparaging racial and gendered speech, known as \"slurs\" or, broadly \"hate speech.\"","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"One other Philosophy module other than YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 is recommended.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
