{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course will examine the relationship between political institutions and aesthetic practices in the works of Plato, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Friedrich Nietzsche. The central question of the course will be whether and how the arts play a role in moral and political education and/or corruption.  We will focus on two key concepts in aesthetic theory, the concept of the beautiful and of mimesis. We will be attentive to the different ways in which Rousseau and Nietzsche respond to specific elements of Platoâ€™s aesthetic theories and how these differences relate to the very different forms of politics that they propose.","title":"Aesthetics and Politics","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3319","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1430","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-ELMCL","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1300","endTime":"1430","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-ELMCL","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":"YCC2121"}
