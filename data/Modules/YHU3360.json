{"moduleCode":"YHU3360","title":"Acting II","description":"This practice-based acting course explores contemporary approaches to global classical theatre. The course is highly collaborative and cultivates a supportive ensemble collectively investigating some of the world’s greatest dramas. Actors deepen their understanding of the Stanislavski character and scene work introduced in Acting I. Performance techniques beyond realism are also explored, including the rasas. Actors rehearse and perform scenes from classical traditions of Greece, India, and China. The selected scripts invite comparative analysis of themes and dramaturgical elements. Rehearsal is required outside course meetings. Exercises and projects train the actor’s instrument, expand one’s understanding of theatre, and foster personal growth.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YHU2319 Acting I or with the permission of the instructor.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
