{"moduleCode":"EN4266","title":"South Asian Literatures in English","description":"This module will introduce a selection of texts across genres from South Asia along with a complementary set of Critical Readings that students will need to apply to the reading of primary texts. The texts will be approached as reflecting conflicts of neo/colonialisms and the complications of modernities, as grappling with issues of gendered and racialized identities; as explorations of issues relating to the underside of globalisation. Students should gain a fairly in-depth knowledge of leading literary works from South Asia. They will also need to produce a final term paper that will potentially be expandable to an Honours thesis.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN or 28 MCs in SN or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN or 28 MCs in SN, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","preclusion":"EN3265","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
