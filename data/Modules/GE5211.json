{"moduleCode":"GE5211","title":"Dynamic Environments","description":"This module introduces techniques through which dynamic environmental conditions can be measured and monitored and provides a basis for reasoned debates about issues related to environmental change. Students following the module can expect to be tutored in a number of techniques that may include (depending upon expertise of staff who are available to teach the module) geomorphic hazard mapping, micro-meteorology, palaeoecology and remote sensing. The module goes on to discuss the implications to humans of past and present environmental dynamism and of predicted environmental changes. Among the topics for student-led discussions in this part of the module are the dialectic of global climate change; the contribution of urban areas to global climate change; possible relationships between biodiversity and environmental instability; and inequalities in the degree of human vulnerability. A seminar presentation focusing on the relevance of the module to their thesis or on thesis topic is expected.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":900,"endTime":1200,"venue":"AS2-0316","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":12}]}]}
