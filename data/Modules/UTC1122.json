Thus, skin is a playground — at the very same time that it is a battle field — where identity is constantly\nreshaped through interaction of words, categories, values, body techniques and emotions.","title":"Skin","department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC1122","semesterData":[]}
