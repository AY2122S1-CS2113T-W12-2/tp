{"moduleCode":"LAD4007","title":"LAD4007 Political Eco and Land","description":"Landscape architecture is not shaped just by environmental and aesthetic considerations, but also by the process of social engagement, social hierarchies, and power structures in society. This module introduces students to key concepts and frameworks of political ecology, which is a broad field of study and research that focuses on socio-environmental conflicts and their origins. Through a variety of teaching and learning modes, students examine landscape case studies representing different contexts, scales, and histories to uncover diverse human?environment interactions. There is an emphasis on applying different tools and methods to conduct and communicate political ecology research.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1800,"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35}]}]}
