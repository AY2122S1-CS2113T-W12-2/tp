{"moduleCode":"TS4216","title":"Theatre and Gender","description":"This module offers students a way to approach theatre and performance through the matrix of gender. Students will be exposed to selected discourses on feminism, masculinity, transgenderism. This module will focus on the issues of language, body, theatricality and performativity and explore how the gender discourses can inform the students’ engagement with these issues, particularly in relation to aesthetics and embodiment. Incorporating a critical, examination of selected play-texts, this module will lead students to develop a project where they can either construct a creative response to a play or a devised reflection on their process of researching gender in theatre.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"AS3-0308","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":25}]}]}
