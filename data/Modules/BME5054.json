{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"The strategy module focuses on the concept of strategy, and examines how firms achieve, sustain,and renew competitive advantage, and what roles managers play in this process. The course covers the basic frameworks and decision making tools, which lay the foundations of strategic change and renewal. Strategy is shaped not only by the underlying market and competitive conditions that prevail in an industry, but also by the resources as well as by the firmâ€™s internal structure, systems, and culture. This integration of the external and internal perspectives provides the basic framework for strategic thinking, and opens the door for more strategic analysis in a variety of context.","title":"Strategy","department":"BIZ Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","workload":[32,0,0,0,30],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"BME5054","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"L2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"2000","weeks":[3],"venue":"E-Hybrid_C","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L3A","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2021-11-18","end":"2021-11-18"},"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":45,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"2000","weeks":[3],"venue":"","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"2000","weeks":[3],"venue":"","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L3B","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2021-11-17","end":"2021-11-17"},"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L3A","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2021-11-20","end":"2021-11-20"},"venue":"","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":45,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L3B","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2021-11-18","end":"2021-11-18"},"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L3B","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2021-11-20","end":"2021-11-20"},"venue":"","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L3A","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2021-11-19","end":"2021-11-19"},"venue":"","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":45,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"2000","weeks":[3],"venue":"","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"2000","weeks":[3],"venue":"E-Hybrid_C","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"2000","weeks":[3],"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L3A","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2021-11-16","end":"2021-11-16"},"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":45,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L3B","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2021-11-19","end":"2021-11-19"},"venue":"","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"2000","weeks":[3],"venue":"E-Hybrid_C","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"2000","weeks":[3],"venue":"E-Hybrid_C","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":20,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L3B","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2021-11-16","end":"2021-11-16"},"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":15,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"L3A","startTime":"0800","endTime":"1800","weeks":{"start":"2021-11-17","end":"2021-11-17"},"venue":"","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":45,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
