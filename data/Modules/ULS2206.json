{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"When we open our eyes, we feel that we are seeing the world as it is in front of us. But scientific studies reveal that we are seeing only a tiny fraction of that world, and that what we do see (and hear, and smell, and touch) is not the world â€œas it isâ€? â€“ but as it is represented to us through the \nfilters of our biology, or technology, and our culture.
