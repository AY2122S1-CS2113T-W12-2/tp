The module covers two branches of fundamental physics: mechanics and electricity & magnetism. Topics included in mechanics are linear motion, circular motion, Newton’s laws of motion, work and energy, conservation of energy, linear momentum, and simple harmonic motion. Topics included in electricity & magnetism are electric force, field & potential, current & resistance, DC circuits, electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction.","title":"Fundamentals of Physics","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,2,4],"prerequisite":"‘O’-level pass in Physics or Combined Science (Physics & Chemistry OR Physics & Biology).","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC1201","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"5","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[4,6,8,10,12],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":200,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":200,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1300","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":50,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","weeks":[3,5,7,9,11],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":40,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT28","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":200,"covidZone":"B"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"LT28","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":200,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"],"examDate":"2022-04-28T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"fulfillRequirements":["PC1431","PC1432"]}
