{"moduleCode":"LL6437","title":"Law and Democracy in East Asia","description":"This module explores diverse development patterns of the rule of law and democracy in East Asia. Theories of democracy commonly hold that the acceptance of rule of law in non-democratic countries would lead to democratization, especially along with increasing economic prosperity. This linear thesis, however, have met challenges recently in light of recent developments in China, HK, and other parts of the world. As such, this module scrutinizes this linear thesis by examining the trajectories of legal development in East Asia and the determinants, such as international factors, civil law traditions, legal professionals, foreign law influence, colonial legacies and post-colonial nationalism.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent","preclusion":"LL4437V/LL5437V/LL6437V Law and Democracy in East\nAsia","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
