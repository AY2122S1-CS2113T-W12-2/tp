{"moduleCode":"UTC3401","title":"CAPT Undergraduate Research Opportunity (UROP)","description":"A UROP involves the student working with a supervisor, and sometimes in a team, on an existing research project. A CAPT UROP may focus on research  related to a \nparticular aspect of life, education or organization at the College. Alternatively, students may participate in research led by a College Fellow or other academic,  as long as the project gives the student exposure to forms of expertise and/or interests that go beyond any particular discipline. The aim of the UROP is to \nhelp support a student’s academic and professional development through a meaningful research apprenticeship. The UROP is a graded module.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","preclusion":"GEM3903","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[]}
