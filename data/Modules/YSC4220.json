{"moduleCode":"YSC4220","title":"Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations","description":"Much of modern science and mathematics is expressed in the language of differential equations. Population models in ecology, financial growth, heat conduction, and water waves are a few examples. In this course, you will solve the classical linear ordinary and partial differential equations.\n\nStudents will assemble a toolbox of mathematical techniques to solve initial and boundary value problems, including integrating factors, separation of variables, and Fourier series.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC2232 Linear Algebra and YSC3240 Foundations of Applied Mathematics or with the permission of the instructor.","preclusion":"YSC3230 Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
