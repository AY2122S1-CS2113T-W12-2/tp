{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"YSS4206A Topics in Psychology: Moral Judgements","description":"This module will introduce students to the study of the origins, development, and cognitive processing of morality. The module will cover the history of moral psychology, and the shift from cognitiveâ€?developmentalist theories of reasoningâ€?based morality to the current social intuitionist theory of intuition and emotion based morality. The course debates whether morality is innate, intuitive, emotionâ€?driven, reasoned, learned, or a dual process. In doing so, we will explore infantsâ€™ and childrenâ€™s moral development, moral emotions, morality through neuroscience, morality across culture and in politics, and moral dilemmas from philosophical thought experiments.","title":"The Psychology of Moral Judgments","department":"Psychology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3.5,6],"prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs of which student must have passed PL1101E, PL2131, PL2132 and 4 out of the 5 core modules (PL3232/PL3102 - PL3236/PL3106), which should include PL3234/PL3104 and PL3235/PL3105, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"PL4235","semesterData":[]}
