{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Global warming. Automation. Biotechnology. Big data. Artificial intelligence. Everywhere we look, science and technology are creating unprecedented challenges and opportunities. At the same time, the creation of technology is something very old, perhaps even defining what it means to be human. In this course, students will engage in original anthropological fieldwork and collaborative writing to investigate burning questions at the juncture of culture and technology. Readings will draw from classic works by Marx, Freud, and Heidegger; feminist and postcolonial critique; and anthropological accounts of phenomena ranging from cutting-edge science to the search for extraterrestrial life.","title":"Technology and Culture","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,2.5,7],"prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3309","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YCC2121"}
