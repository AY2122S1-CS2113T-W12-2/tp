{"moduleCode":"PP5012","title":"Leading Innovation and Change","description":"The module will examine how public and privte managers respond to external disruptive innovations in industries and markets, and how they balance existing labour laws, consumer protection, and quality control with the emerging\neconomic opportunities and customer demand. It will examine how managers have to innovate their own policies, practices, and assumptions in responding to\nassertive stakeholder demands and technological developments. The module will also examine the role of public sector managers in creating a conducive climate for\nentrepreneurship and overcome pervasive institutional and individual forces constraining change and renewal, and the inherent ‘risk averse’ cultures of many\nbureaucracies.","moduleCredit":1.0,"department":"LKYSPP Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":830,"endTime":2000,"venue":"LKY_SR3-5","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":90}]}]}
