{"moduleCode":"FMS1212P","title":"SYC: Simple Yet Complex","description":"Students often tend to think that if a system displays a complex behavior, it must be itself somehow complicated, difficult to describe. The aim of the module is to show, in a playful way, that this is not (always) the case, that really simple systems ranging from physics, meteorology, engineering, computer science, biology and economics, can have a rich, complex … and unpredictable behavior. Many notions are at the heart of this module such as determinism versus predictability, chaos, the need for a statistical description, random walks, ergodicity, entropy, fractals, cellular automata, self-organized criticality, emergent behavior, etc.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","preclusion":"Students who have read a Freshman Seminar before will be precluded from reading a second Freshman Seminar.\n\nStudents staying in Residential Colleges in UTown who will be reading or have read the Junior Seminars will be precluded from reading Freshman Seminar in the Faculty.","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1400,"endTime":1600,"venue":"S16-0309","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15}]}]}
