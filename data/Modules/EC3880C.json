{"moduleCode":"EC3880C","title":"Topics in Economics: Economic History of Southeast Asia","description":"This module provides a broad overview of Southeast Asian economic history from “pre-modern” times to the present day. The focus will be broad rather than narrow, and we shall devote attention both to internal developments in Southeast Asia and to the region’s long and varied engagement with other parts of the world. Some familiarity with economic concepts and with Southeast Asian history obviously will be helpful, but there are no prerequisites for the module. The course will be conducted in lecture/discussion format.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
