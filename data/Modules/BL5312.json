{"moduleCode":"BL5312","title":"Natural History Collections and Conservation","description":"Can the dead save the Earth? Natural history collections, being crucial repositories of biological specimens, are indispensable for scientific research and public education. This module highlights the importance of research and display of natural history collections to biodiversity conservation, with emphasis on Southeast Asia, which is one of the most biotically threatened regions. Topics include the changing roles of natural history collections from the past to the future, and different aspects of specimen-based research—from the field to the museum shelves and public gallery, to the world beyond via applications in research (e.g., ecology, evolution, global change) and scientific communication.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1800,"endTime":2200,"venue":"S2-0414","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":20}]}]}
