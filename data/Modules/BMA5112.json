{"moduleCode":"BMA5112","title":"Asian Business Environments","description":"The class goal is to build understanding of strategies that respond to Asia’s business environments—a set of business environments as diverse as there is in the entire world. The first part of the coursefocuses on major components of the business environment. Key components include government policies and institutions, macroeconomic factors such as foreign exchange rates and resource endowments, and the influence of local communities and culture. The second part of the course then explores business responses to contextual features, which themselves form part of the environment for doing business in Asia. Specific business responses examined may vary year to year in keeping with shifting realities.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"BIZ Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":true,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"P1","startTime":1830,"endTime":2130,"venue":"BIZ1-0203","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66},{"classNo":"F1","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"BIZ1-0307","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66},{"classNo":"F1A","startTime":1200,"endTime":1500,"venue":"E-Hybrid_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66},{"classNo":"P1A","startTime":1830,"endTime":2130,"venue":"BIZ1-0203","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":66}]}]}
