{"moduleCode":"UTC1413","title":"Jr Sem: A Brief History of Inequality","description":"Should we believe claims that ‘country X has high inequality’ or that ‘inequality is increasing’? How does inequality today compare with inequality in past societies? Where does our modern concern about inequality come from – why did past societies accept inequality as a given? This module investigates the causes of inequality in different societies, from the Ancient world to modern Singapore. It also traces the development of the concept itself, using modern tools and frameworks from a range of disciplines to analyse the social, political and economic inequalities present in the world today.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
