{"moduleCode":"MDG5241","title":"Advanced Statistical Methods for Bioinformatics","description":"The module will present modern statistical methods for analyzing large-scale -omics data, with emphasis on application to real-world data. A variety of statistical methods and computing approaches will be covered, including hypothesis testing for high-dimensional data, dimension reduction techniques, and machine learning methods commonly employed in -omics data analysis such as tree-based methods and support vector machine. The module will also include in-class computing exercise for model estimation and inference, such as the expectation-maximization algorithm and sampling-based Bayesian inference. The module will end with advanced statistical approaches for the integration of two or more -omics data.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"NUS Medicine Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","prerequisite":"College-level statistics or statistics modules designed for life science majors; background in biology/chemistry preferred, but not required; some familiarity with R","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
