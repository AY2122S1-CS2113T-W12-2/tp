It also considers the reflexive potential of film and television to comment their socioâ€?political role as well as on their own representation of politics. The module explores these themes in a variety of cinematic and televisual ways of representing politics, including documentaries, dramas, historical reâ€?enactments, and comedies.","title":"Politics on Screen","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[1,2,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PS2256","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
