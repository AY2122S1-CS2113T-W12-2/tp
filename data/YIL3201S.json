{"acadYear":"2020/2021","description":"The goal of this course is to give students the ability to read literary texts in classical Sanskrit. To that end, this course will focus on selections from a variety of Sanskrit literary and philosophical texts (e.g., Somadeva tales, Åšatakas of Bhartá¹›ihari, the SÄ?nÌ‡khyakÄ?rikÄ? of ÄªÅ›varakrÌ£sÌ£nÌ£a, and the KÄ?vyaprakÄ?Å›a of MammatÌ£a). This course will also discuss a number of advanced and rare grammatical forms in Sanskrit, as and when they come in the selected readings. Using skills developed in the basic and intermediate levels of the language, students will translate and discuss the relevant sections throughout the semester.","title":"Directed Language Study: Advanced Sanskrit","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,4,0,2,6.5],"prerequisite":"YIL2201S Directed Language Study: Intermediate Sanskrit or equivalent","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YIL3201S","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1930","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-GLRm2","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15,"covidZone":"A"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1900","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-GLRm2","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15,"covidZone":"A"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1800","endTime":"1930","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"Y-GLRm2","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":15,"covidZone":"A"}],"covidZones":["A"],"examDate":"2020-11-28T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":180}],"prereqTree":"YIL2201S"}
